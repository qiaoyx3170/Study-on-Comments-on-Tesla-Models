Lectron CCS to Tesla Adapter :  Dual-Level Tesla Charger:  (Amazon) CCS to Tesla Adapter: 
"I was a landlord for 20 years and this sounds exactly like my experience. If dealing with difficult renters and abusive situations doesnt really bother you too much, you can make money doing this over time. For most folks, however, you just get tired of engaging with messed up people who have the ability to damage and destroy anything that gets within a sniff of their ecosphere. And thats with 90% of my tenants being good to deal with. It was that lousy 10% that made me get out. Been six years since I sold that last property and so glad to be away from all that."
"Really interesting video, great to see more details on how something like Turo works for the longer term. As a consumer, I rented from Turo once (to test drive a MY before I got mine) and it was a great experience. The host was SUPER nice and even contacted Turo on my behalf when I screwed up and returned the car ""late"" (It was back in the driveway an hour early, but I didnt know how to use the app, so I didnt push the right buttons to check it back in until a few hours later). But from a hosting perspective Ive always said ""never"". Seems like too ripe for abuse or something to go wrong and that seems to be the case for you. Just like AirBNB. While I know Im not going to abuse someones car or home... unfortunately way too many people in this world have the mentality of ""Its not mine so who cares!"" rather than being raised right with the mentality of ""Its not mine, so I should treat it"
This sounds like a nightmare of a business. Kudos to you for doing it for that long of a time despite all the issues.
"I only got through 6 trips on my 2019 model 3 on Turo before I pulled it. The hassle of dealing with irresponsible drivers and battling with TURO to get compensated for guest extra charges was making me feel the projected value was not worth the time. Mostly, came down to last guest that smoked in the car and left their smoke smelling jacket in the car for me to bring home. Since it is my secondary vehicle and Im allergic to cigarette smoke, I could not have that happen again. It took months to get rid of the smell."
"Tried to rent cars thru Turo a couple of times, and its clear you were one of the better people renting your car out. When the listing is passive aggressive to begin with, its just easier to deal with one of the car rental companies. Like AirBnB, I think its an idea that doesnt work with most people who dont bother to put in the effort you did."
"This is exactly how i feel about being a host for airbnb and uber, both of which Ive done. Trusting with people with your own belongings is an exercise in frustration. Theyre almost always selfish and the pay simply has never been worth it for me."
Great video and you gave it a reasonable time as a trial. Appreciate you sharing your experiences. Enjoy the channel Ryan!
You actually rented it out 100 times? I’m done after two
"I own a Model 3, so I decided to rent one through Turo for the first time around Christmas - a slight splurge over a regular rental. I curbed one wheel, and the owner insisted on replacing the whole wheel, costing me about $720, rather than the $125 fix. Initial claim was for $2200, because she thought she might have to claim loss of income from not being able to rent it, plus a rental car for that time, as if a scrape on the side of one wheel somehow made the car inoperable. Ridiculous. Had other issues with the owner - she was late for pickup and lied that she was stuck in traffic. Her sentry cam showed that she left her house 20 minutes after she wrote she was stuck in traffic. And she delivered it with a 44% charge. While I was waiting for the wheel to be sorted out, the time to leave a review expired, so now it seems, I have no recourse for the insane charge, late pick up, and low state of charge at delivery. Though if someone has advice, Id love to hear it."
I had a nightmare experience with my very first rental. The renter drove all the way to the border of Mexico before I contacted him and stopped him from going to Mexico with my truck. He was mad that I had ruined his plans even though he had originally told me he was going to Vegas. Total bs. So my first Turo rental was my last one. I’ve been a guest many times and it has been great each time.
"Great video! We’ve rented a 3 and Y through Hertz and it’s hard to beat. The cost was exceptional, all things considered. Hard to rent on Turo when a 3 is dirt cheap and pick up/return is at the airport."
"""I just dont want to"" is an underrated statement."
"Thanks, I am surprised you lasted that long. People will treat them like rentals and trash them, and hope you do not spot the damage when they return them, but on the plus side it helped with your channel and you got a few videos out of it."
Wow thanks Ryan for elaborating the nooks and crannies of how joining Turo requires an patience and backbone with guests taking your teslas. I hope you and your family get an awesome tesla soon when you sell plaid and 3. We all learn from you a lot so God bless you and keen observations going forward.
Hey Ryan. You are way more patient than I am!! I would’ve been out after the red Y issues! Thanks for sharing. My Y is staying in my garage for my wife and my use only!
"Another great and detailed video, Ryan! Thank you for confirming our decision not to dance the Turo is the right one! I have to wonder how your red Y is doing with the new owner today!"
"1) Your honesty combined with excellent video creation skills make your channel truly EXCELLENT. . 2) It seems to be the case that once again a few bad apples spoiled things for everyone. One could argue that, on a macro scale, that is how we wound up with climate change, the national debt, and the war in Ukraine."
"As a customer I love Turo for trying out potential car purchases. We rented in the past few years Tesla 3, S, Nissan Leaf and Chevy Bolt all for 3 days each. We ended up buying a Nissan Leaf SV plus as our town car, and a Subaru Outback as our road car."
Even tho the business didn’t work out as expected you were able to bond with your old man while making some money the best thing we got is our folks
"Nice review. Many, if not most, of the Euro disadvantages will apply to using robotaxi option on ones personal car. I remain unconvinced FSD-robotaxis will be anything other than a replacement for regular taxis/Ubers/etc. Niche market."
Great video. Yeah I simply couldnt handle the stress of dealing with bad renters.
I rented a model Y from hertz and the amount of road rash that was on the right rear tire was insane. That has to be an endless hassle for anyone renting those cars.
"I have 7 teslas on turo rn and it really is a full time job. I enjoy talking to people though and love tesla so it’s just a fun thing I do. I make money elsewhere passively so this keeps me busy. I’m sorry to see others having a bad experience as I always do my best to go above and beyond. I have over 300 trips and have a 5 star review. My end goal is either robo taxi or just sell them all off and buy another house. Spring and summer travel should be fun and might even add the ultra red plaid S to complete my collection as I have the 3,X,Y."
I have thought about it since my area doesn’t have many Teslas. But I know myself I would be constantly watching the app to see what they were doing. I am too picky about my cars plus so many bad drivers out there. Thanks for sharing your story.
Thanks for the honest review. Renting out your cars sounded way too stressful for the rewards
Thank you for your review. I was considering renting my 2023 model y on days I wont use it but it seems like a hassle dealing with people and the limited time required to have the vehicle rental ready; especially if you want to make money
Great video on good and bad renting on turo. When you list your cars a link would be nice.
I literally set my turo up yesterday to rent my Tesla. Now i know better
"I love my cars too much to rent it, and dont have time for this kind of business. Glad there are more reasons then I even anticipated to avoid it. Sorry you had to go thru all of this"
And this is why I couldnt rent my car out once fsd is available. Ill use it for long trips where I can relax. Thanks for the honest review.
"Great review Ryan, for me it would not be worth the headache."
Thank you for this video! I’ve always thought about renting my Tesla Turo after I purchase my next car. This has definitely helped me make my decision!
Thank you so much for sharing your experience with Turo.
"Sounds exactly like my experience m, my brother and I have 30 cars in our Turo fleet. It’s a ton of work but it’s fun when all the cars are Rentee out. I definitely underestimated the sheer stupidity of the general public renting cars. They don’t read and complain about the things they didn’t read. Omg. 1 year in, a few hundred rentals, I’ll keep at it. Just had one car totaled but Turo did pay it off which was nice. Thought I was gonna still be on the hook for the difference"
"i considered getting a couple of cheap barely qualifying cars to do turo. upon some researach, dealing with scummy people in vegas was red flags galore to start. maintainence wasnt so much an issue, as i can fix them myself. but when i would look at the prices customers pay, and so on, I just didnt see it as profitable. turo is best if you have a second car that sits a lot, its paid off, and let it make a few bucks for ya...enough to say use that older second car to make the payments on your newer car."
"I thought you were more than balanced with your Turo review, Ryan. You obviously went the extra mile (sorry about the pun) to maintain your fleet and provide excellent customer service. Unfortunately, I agree with many of the posts here: some renters (hopefully a very small number) dont care about returning anything they rent -- cars, tools, you name it -- in decent or original condition. And not surprisingly, nagging, complaining and lying are their MOs."
"Thanks for sharing your experience! It doesn’t seem worth it for anyone. Plus, Hertz and other car rentals are buying up Teslas, so pretty soon it won’t be a unique enough experience to attract renters away from the traditional guys."
"Such a good detailed and insightful video, thanks!"
anyone: how do you feel about utilizing your personal vehicle as a robotaxi once FSD is developed for this purpose?
"I love your Videos, cause you explain the complicated things very understandable"
"I believe, during Investor Day - the presentation you referenced, they demonstrated how (using custom software and enhanced computational approaches) theyve further improved the magnetic efficiency of the motor. So, while the hairpin design and increased copper fill factor allow for less weight (remove 20% of previous materials and keep the same power output) this factor alone probably doesnt represent the full contribution to enhancement. I think the software control of these magnetic fields is doing a lot of good."
"Its interesting to see that Lucid Motors have been using these more efficient, but I assume more expensive, hairpin motors from the beginning, while Tesla opted to use the less advanced wire motors. In my opinion this was possible for Lucid because they chose to focus entirely on luxury which affords them the leeway to use more expensive components."
"Both VW and Lucid are already doing this. It was in R&D to insure good temperature and efficiency to create good range and performance. For Lucid, check their YouTube channel on their Tech Talks. There is a lot that can be learned there on the engineering and design on the Air."
"Padme Amidala was a Mandalorian bounty hunter. She was known for her daring feats and skill with a blaster. But today, she had a diferent mission. She was looking for her hairpin, which had fallen into the engine of her Tesla Why."
"These motors are liquid cooled with pumped coolant like in a gasoline engine, I reckon the coolant should be liquid Nitrogen to make the magnets super conducting."
Who did notice this at 9:59 . Dont think I want that motor!
"Not an expert, alas. I may be wrong, but I am under the impression that Tesla uses permanent magnets in high efficiency/low power motors, while high-power, low efficiency motors are induction designs, and its in induction motors that you will find hairpin stators. If that is correct (please do correct me, readers), then Teslas improved permanent magnets with no rare earths are a completely separate innovation. And by far, the more impressive innovation. Hairpin stators are not new. Teslas improved permanent magnets are. That is one innovation that will make competitors sweat bullets. I doubt they will know how to pull that off."
So Porsche pioneered and commercialized the hairpin design? Publicly Tesla will take credit and be showered with accolades. A double standard? Why not give credit where credit is due? Could it be that league leading Tesla is copying other engineers technologies? Legacy gets bashed quite a bit but they too are not standing still.
"Hi. How is the performance? Is the car lively enough? Unfortunately I havent been able to drive a MY SR so far, only the LR or Performance."
Quick question - Model 3 or Model Y??
"Recently got my base model3 with the 19” rims like yours, but all black and got tint, and I have the black colored insides looks amazing. Such a delightful and smooth experience driving the M3."
"The suspension is supposed to be upgraded to a much more comfortable version for all 2023 Model 3 and Model Ys, perhaps thats why you dont find it that bad :)"
Great video man! Ive heard the Tesla Model 3 is a great car. Thanks for the video and keep up the great work on your videos
Did the $250 deposit this past Saturday night and am picking it up TOMORROW!!! All done in 1 week also bought on a “whim” due to price drops and tax credit.
I just took delivery of my Model 3 RWD and I charge it up to 100% about once or twice a week. The reason for this is because we are currently experiencing extreme weather and I am preparing for massive power outages. Once summer comes around I will likely just charge to 90% weekly and 100% monthly to recalibrate the range. (I work from home)
Personally do not like any form of screens in cars they are too distracting and after time suffer more issues than having switches. A phone mount and your phone does the same “interactivety” stuff and won’t be out of date in a few years
Is it true that a IF your blocked in by criminals your Tesla WONT let you crash into a car to save your life?
Couldn’t pay me to own a Tesla. So many better cars are available.
I am a little surprised that the normal bz4x charging is to 80%. Not as bad as during the 1000km test. So the May update should be interesting to see the improvements on the bz4x.
Too bad the American version of the Bz4X AWD has an even slower charging battery. That makes throttled charging even worse.
With the Ariya Im driving I mostly beating other colleagues (id4s ix3 and kona-e) on the longer drives. Flat and constant charging curves just simply is a more suitable solution on a day to day base.
Seems like a poor charge with the Model Y. I think my 3 does a little better in the 50-70% range
"But I dont understand why they would throttle after a certain amount of charging, Ive never heard of another automaker doing that on purpose."
"Warranty 1 Million kilometers? Given the 1000 km challenge, driving 1 Million kilometers should take ca. 600 days when driving 24/7, right? With 8 hours driving per day, thats like 5 years."
What does the warranty actually say?
Hello is it better to charge your car with simple charger or home install charger and how does it work?
"Toyota EVs are so uncompetitive. ABC, always be catching up."
"The slow charging is one thing, but then you throw the bad efficiency on top of that and its just a mess for Toyota. That makes the Model Y around twice as fast when measuring in miles/minute, or even more vs the cold-gated Toyota charge curve."
"The one benefit I imagine comes from HVAC stealing power from the BMS during charging is when the battery is below freezing temperatures. Charging quickly with frozen batteries causes degredation, so a dump load that reduces or prevents charging until the batteries are not under a temp limit is good. But i dont understand why this would apply to a slightly tepid battery and no thermal management action."
toyota has million kilometer warranty? what?
"The throttled speed is way too slow and it drops down way too fast. Id much rather see 40kw flat til 80%, just like its a Zoe. 20kw at 60% just isnt acceptable."
Toyota is just 10 years behind. We just have to accept that.
Never buy tech with a promise of future updates
Basically get a Tesla
Elon ownage as usual! Tesla ftw
"Mister Green had always been prout of his Toyota B27litreV12. It was a beautiful car, with sleec lines and a powerful engine that roared to life whenever he turned the key. But lately, Mister Green had noticed thad his fuel economy wasnt what it used to be. He was spending more and more money on gas, and he knew that he needed to do something about idt."
I am surprised how slow the best selling Tesla charges for a car that is supposed to be 5 years ahead of the competition.
underrated youtuber...
"Superb, now Im waiting for perfect conditions for electrics (I hope in April / May) to redo the test :) Im looking forward to it. Good luck in everything you do :)"
Absolutely incredible this video. Congratulations to all participants!
"Interesting test, maximum caterinca on the way:)) Maybe Ill get to the summer test with a Peugeot e-2008. Good luck!"
"Very interesting test, congratulations for the work done! Interesting that at low speed Tesla LR and 3 and Y is more efficient than Tesla SR. And at higher speeds SR is more efficient but not by much. I did not expect this!"
Congratulations on the assembly! Im also waiting for the summer test!
"Great test! Ive always wondered, none of the electric bike builders thought of putting an additional smaller pedal for the left foot, like the ""hand"" brake, for the braking energy recovery function, at least in two stages. I think that it was easier to operate than the paddles on the steering wheel (some models dont even have paddles on the steering wheel)"
"Great test, I think its the most interesting for those who want to buy an electric, so each separately is subjective."
Congratulations on the organization Very good test
20:42 I had that consumption with the i3 at 150km/h :) I did a test from Snagov to Bucharest:)
"I greet you with respect, gentlemen! This clip is very beautiful and useful, at least for those interested and electric fans (if not owners). If there really will be such a test in the summer season as well, I think it would be epic and would go down in history, if a drone filmed the entire column of electrics on the road. Maybe other models will come, like Model X from Tesla, Plaid, even other non-Tesla models. I, for one, think it would be a wonderful sight with such a column of electric cars, seen from above (and I think Im not the only one)."
"With the new prices for the Model Y, it has become more appealing for everyone, however, some range is lost, as the rims influence the consumption so much, it would be interesting to participate also a Model Y with Model 3 rims."
"Well done gentlemen! Interesting! If you want a 38 Ioniq for the upcoming test, you have a volunteer in me."
"With the CONFIRMATION of my colleague with Y, I am also taking crossclimate...I didnt know it existed"
Super caravan...now it remains to be seen if Bjorn accepts the invitation
"Congratulations for the test, double like from me!"
"Congratulations on the test! Cool! Im curious if they were left overnight in similar conditions, like everyone outside or everyone upside down, and if they all stayed charged overnight or not. That there may be differences in consumption and battery temperature. Fain consum has released the Y LR model even at highway speed! :D"
"Is it true that Tesla car owners were notified that starting on 09.03.2023 charging at superchargers in Romania will be chargeable? Just a curiosity, I own an Opel Corsa Electric. I would also like to see if you have the possibility to do such a test with more budget cars, poorer so to speak."
"I really had enormous questions about model 3 and Y, Im undecided and now Im even better prepared with my decision"
"It was good to put the temperature somewhere, I also think that some subtitles in English could increase the visibility outside because the test is relevant for everyone. Otherwise, thank you very much for the effort."
"Congratulations, tomorrow is two weeks since I have an electric car, and I have 1800 km..I am super satisfied."
"I live on Ontario Canada and the rear camera of my Model 3 gets completely blocked after driving a few minutes in the snow. Plus, the rear-facing side cameras often get covered with road grim when the roads are wet or snow-covered. If Tesla wants to use only cameras, they need a way to keep them clean while driving and have better placement, especially for the front. Currently, the front-facing camera has a significant blind spot in front of the bumper."
Thanks Sean! Great reporting as usual.
Thank you for another great show and have a good weekend
"The 7th gen Mustang needs an AME fascia. The grill area is so big. Specifically the main element. I feel like they could done a better job designing the split between the top/bottom sections. The rear tail lights look kinda odd to me too. And as far as the display graphics go, all I can think of the cost of module replacement. I gotta say, despite those issues...I really want a Dark Horse edition!"
Yes. Drone robots will fly out of the frunk and clean the camera lenses.
"Actually from what we saw on invester day, it looks like the 4680 development has come very far. They may only produce 1000 cars a week with 4680 but if performance and quality is there it is just a matter of time until it is ramped."
Access to these ultrasonic sensors has been a big issue for GM and other manufacturers in the last year or two. Both GM and Ford had to halt production because they could not get them. Tesla wanted to make their own but they could not secure the rights to do so. Therefore they made the decision to find a way to delete them. Its old news btw. Tesla dropped the sensors months ago.
"See for yourself how well Teslas FSD Beta handles challenging unprotected left-hand turns (during rush hour, on a 50 mph road) in Chuck Cooks latest Youtube video. Chuck is an airline pilot. Hes been rigorously testing FSD Beta for two years - for fun!"
"My Model Y ultrasonic sensors dont work with snow on them. If the cameras are heated, that will solve the problem. The bigger problem is the windshield wipers freezing up while driving when it snows."
They dropped the Ultrasonics Last year in September.
I’ve found that snow is not an issue for the Tesla cameras. What is an issue is that they will get dirtied up by driving on roads with salt or whatever. So I sometimes need to go out and rinse the cameras with distilled water.
YOU GUYS SHOULD START Taking us for a RIDE IN SOME OF THE PRESS CARS YOU GUYS GET HAVE A BEAUTIFUL DAY EVERYONE ️
There is something fishy about Teslas spin story regarding the delay of the Cyber Truck.
Wow BMW is just amazing!
"Not just snow but ice, dirt and mud. I assume attention to keep those areas clean is important. I my backup camera has to be constantly keep clean."
"""...and wed like to hear from the Tesla Community"" Lol, doubt youll even need to ask"
"Cybertruck production remains on schedule to start mid-year (only 3 months away!). Ramping to volume production by year end. Over a million people, who pre-ordered, await the most anticipated vehicle since the Mustang. Tesla will announce pricing and other details in Q2. Itll be wild seeing those beasts on the road."
Off topic - with SVB financial failing will this affect Tesla’s huge customer base in Silicon Valley. Could this be a contagion?
"I loved the ultrasonic sensors and radar adaptive cruise control on my VW Egolf. Never failed me, and very few phantom breaking events over 60,000 miles driven. My new Tesla has neither. Parking it without ultrasonics feels barbaric; the lack of rear cross traffic alerts is disconcerting- especially with the abysmal rear visibility out of the model y. The reversing camera gets crusted with salt in just a few minutes in this car (the previous car kept that under its emblem except when reversing and never needed cleaning once in its life) and the vision based cruise control makes phantom breaking errors often; especially when cresting hills. Also phantom windshield wipe events on nights when it hasnt rained in days and the windshield is clean- which is startling when it happens."
Its not just snow that blocks cameras grime and dirt do a very good job of reducing the effectiveness of cameras.
"If I use this for navigation over Teslas map, wont I lose the benefit of real time tracking/estimation on range left?"
Thanks for sharing! Do you know if the Tesla wireless charger can maintain a full charge on there phone with Hotspot and Bluetooth supporting this device? Btw.. will you get demonetized by Google for the music youre playing? Hope not!
"Can you help clarify something? The link you posted to the product says it requires a SIM card, but your unit does not. Can you help clarify? Thanks again for posting this!"
"can you show what happens to all the tesla build in apps when you are connected to this devices wifi, i would think they loose their internet connection, unless... the car is connected to the wifi of the Carlink and the Carlink is connected to the hotspot of the iphone."
"Does it let you listen to AND respond to text messages, WhatsApp messages, and Messenger messages?"
It was very funny how you commanded my Alexa device to play music when you spoke to your device.
Do you have to reconnect hotspot everytime get back in?
"You should actually look into the original item, that is a chinese knockoff of the Tesla Android project lacking a lot of security and enhancements and implements lots of shortcuts the original developer never approved. Its slow, requires a SIM card (the Tesla Android project does not) and has mani disadvantages."
I think you loose Tesla voice command feature if your not on Tesla network
Cool.
Please find out how to set up 360 camera in Tesla
The amount of work and time you put into your videos is not an easy task. Thank you for your videos!!
"Great Video Dave, the warming on the FLP maybe different in heating / cooling due to the packaging, I believe the Tesla uses Prismatic LFP packs which is physically different than the cylindrical 2170 batteries with the ribbon cooling / heating channels."
"Great video Dave, Ive been loving the series on charging in upstate NY at the opened up chargers. I havent made it to one yet, but happened to be at the Malta station days before they opened it up. I have a 2022 Model Y LR but not the CCS adapter and have been wanting to test it out. If youll be around the area (Brewster or Red Hook) over the next few days and want to test out charging on a non-LFP pack Model Y, let me know and Ill see if I can meet you."
Hey Dave. What do you think would be the time difference road tripping a Model 3 LFP vs Model 3 Long Range?
"You’re not going to see a speed difference. The other difference between CCS and Tesla besides connector, is software. They speak a different language in layman’s terms. That’s why older Tesla cars required a hardware change which added an ECU to translate between the two (like the one I added to mine). While your physical connector may have changed over to a CCS, I doubt that the software protocol changed from the default Tesla language. Nice to see that the adapter(s) doesn’t slow down the charge rate. This might be useful for those that tow. Been waiting for supercharger extensions to become available again, may switch to a CCS1 since it will be more flexible."
"Nice video, Dave. Heres an idea for your next video: since you live so close to New York, which has a total of 8 Tesla supercharger locations with magic docks, why dont you, or your wife, or both of you, take a trip throughout upstate NY testing each of those locations using your wifes GV60. On you way out you can charge on only superchargers with magic docks, and on your way back, use only CCS to compare which takes you the least amount of time. You would get a ton of views. Maybe your highest viewed video ever as you will be the first one doing this."
Dave do you get an option when ordering a Model 3 on the LFP or a standard battery? Seems kinda important with the charging speed differences youve shown from 250kwh to 170kwh. Im in a 2015 P85D so I max out at 128kwh and thats only at that rate for a few seconds.
When will you test FSD Beta V11? Hoping it will perform better than your last beta run…
"I was interested in your observation that your new battery type requires good heating before charging efficiently. Since most people are going to be using a Supercharger on road trips they should always use Tesla navigation to get there. Navigation preconditions the battery, but just driving to the Supercharger without navigation will not necessarily bring the battery to optimal conditions. Am I correct on that?"
Now that is what it is like to have Disposable Income..love the videos..gonna make the N.Y. to Cape Coral trip soon using your recommendations for supercharger spots...2022 Model S. Keep uo the great work!
5% to 25% in 5 minutes. Pretty good considering it has a lower max charge power than other Teslas!
"The Magic Dock CCS adapter seems to be rated at 350kw and I think that Tesla is considering that to be a hard limit, unlike their in-house cable/connector specs that they violate - Tesla did their cables and software right - they monitor the temperature and just let it rip at ""any"" current so long as temperatures are within safety margins."
Has anyone tried the Polestar 2 on the Magic Dock?
"I wonder if, even though you’re using the adapters, the charger still knows that it’s plugged into a Tesla."
"The main reason (without getting super technical) as to why Tesla V3 charge slower on 800V EVs is due to Teslas current superchargers being 400V architeture, whereas EAs and some other high speed chargers are 800V architecture, meaning they dont need to supply super high amperage to supercharge your EV. They do it with high voltage instead and low amps, meaning you get 1/4 less losses and 1/4 less heat (P=I²R -- high heat degrades the batteries faster, hence Tesla limiting it to a very short time), and therefore 800V architecture EVs are not designed to accept very high amperage as they dont need to. Now, Teslas next generation V4 superchargers will be 800V architecture, which are currently being installed in Europe first. Cant wait till they get here."
Awesome Dave! You may be the first to record north of 155 kW using the magic docks! And you were the first to use the magic dock on the GV60! Appreciate you! Start a patreon!
"At 15:18, you mention interest in comparing with a Long Range. Dave, I might be able to help you with some testing, as I live in Connecticut (we met at the IONIQ 5 filming in Tolland, and at the Pipistrel electric plane event in Waterbury), and I have a 2018 Model 3 Long Range, and an OBD dongle to be sure my battery is preconditioned properly prior to charging. Twitter DM or email me if youd like to try to meet up in Brewster, which is only an hour away from me. Note, I dont have the CCS retrofit for my older 2018 to be able to use the CCS adapter yet, it seems like that might not matter at Magic Dock, not entire sure, so it could still be interesting to see if that would even work. I also know F-150 and Rivian R1T drivers who might be interested in meeting with you, should that be of interest for future video ideas too."
"Dave, since you’ve been to the site a few times to the employees at the local Dunkin’ Donuts know you by first name"
"Great videos Dave, enjoy a coffee on me"
"Great video Dave. My new Y has the 2170 batteries, not LFP and not 4680’s as I thought as my Tesla delivery person told me. So I will expect higher KWh charging and not take it to 100% state of charge unless I am on a trip."
It would be counterproductive for Tesla to handicap the CCS charge rate. They want them charged up and moving on as fast as possible to free up that charger for the next car.
"May I ask, Did you check your charging on the the screen to make sure you werent also charged there also"
"Can you create a video charging CCS at a non-Tesla station, e.g. electrify america? Im curious how it performs so I can decide whether to buy an adapter or not for the 23 model 3."
Wouldve stopped charging 10 % and switched.
Should’ve come to Shirley on Long Island!
Not sure if your test is accurate. The Tesla dispenser still probably recognized your Tesla car even with the CCS adapter. You need to test your wifes car and your Tesla at the same time.
"Makes no sense for Tesla to artificially slow down non Tesla charging, they just end up being there longer taking up space."
Tesla 3 rear wheel is limited to 170kWh. The V1 and V2 superchargers are limited to 150kWh. The V3 chargers go to 250kWh. That says these with the  Magic Dock  are of the V3 kind.
How many cars get charged not how long they charge is what should be the objective in charging infrastructure. No need to slow a non Tesla car. Theyll be holding the space longer than they need to. Affecting the charging of all cars
TFTC
"The car’s onboard charger decides what speed it will be charging at, the charging station doesn’t have a say."
Sending much love to you and your wife especially as she goes through the treatment
Great video - bring on the great EV rollout
"We all pray the treatment is going well for Shannon,another insightful video fella"
Always great videos... praying for your Shannon and family mate!
"Shanna, just wanted to let you know that you are in our thoughts and we are all sending positive vibes your way - just look at all the thumbs ups!"
cant see this happening in Australia any time soon as long as companies and distributers can keep ripping us off.
"Mate, I wish your wife and your family all the very best of luck and hope that your wife can recover from this horrible disease soon."
Prayers to your wife my friend. Best of luck to you and your family!
"Hi Sam, do you think this applies to Australia as well? I really want to get an MG4 when they arrive but I have a bad feeling they are going to be charging more like 50k rather than 40k when they come."
"I don’t think the wholesale price of battery inputs will necessarily stay down because the Ukraine war has put pressure on many of them. But I’m definitely holding out for the prices of EV to come down and I agree that the adoption of EVs is likely to be a lot quicker than the legacy media are saying. I would add that other than the batteries which are expensive and have their own carbon footprint problems(which I think will be aggressively addressed, while ICE tech is already optimised) EV are inherently cheaper to manufacture because they drastically simpler. They have one moving part in the engine,and don’t even need a transmission. That’s why the Chinese manufacturers are selling very small EVs for well under $10K US."
"I look forward to this great EV takeover!!! I really don’t want to purchase any EVs from a Legacy Automaker! I wish to buy from a “Startup” like Fisker, Tesla or Lucid! Prayers for your Family bro."
Cant wait to get a great EV the same price as ICE car here in Aus. The thought of charging it in thr comfort of own home and anywhere with a power plug is quite liberating.
My heart is with you and your family and the very best wishes to your wife.
Love it Sam! Best to your family
"Thank you for all your research and the information you pass on, its very helpful in this quickly changing world, I subbed a while ago. I hope your wifes treatment is successful"
Sounds like this is what everyone was hoping for.
"Wonder if Aptera can get their hands on some of CATL or BYDs sodium batteries to do a battery pack refresh. The idea of a 400 mile vehicle with no lithium, better temperature tolerance and better safety for way less is kinda awesome (math for volume and weight checks out)."
"Loved this video. You said the EV revolution is here with such conviction, and I believe you. It is Friday, 10th March 2023 and we gonna reflect how quickly the EV revolution took place, and I wonder where will the Tesla share be I five years."
Theres going to be a glut of cars in general at the end of this year because of increased production and lack of sales thanks to a global recession and high interest rates.
Im still waiting on a small pickup. Maverick was tempting but I would like a plug in and longer battery range.
"Really good video. The presentation says everything about Tesla, good and bad. The perfect electric car does not exist. The pricing must be frightening for the competitors and must be described as a direct knockout. It will be interesting to follow the sales figures on the European car market in the coming months."
"Excellent review - the best Ive seen so far of the Tesla Y (and Ive seen many). However, also a call for self-examination, because you have previously praised the same car for having the best assistant systems on the market! A good argument for always driving a few thousand kilometers in such a test car... :)"
Thanks for the good video. Maybe you can make one of the German version TMY too?
Totally agree with everything! Your videos are always top quality. (have a model y myself) both happy and at times disappointed with my own
Great that you share your views ️ makes you completely right that they lack a display so speed is visible in front of a ️️️
Thanks for another great review. You know your stuff :)
"Good and fair review, its great that you are so forthright in your feedback. Have a Model 3 - and although it is probably the best car I have ever owned, I very much agree with your views. The chassis in the 3, however, feels quite OK, and the steering wheel gives fine feedback, even though it is all electronic, and in terms of driving dynamics it feels like a small go-cart. I think it has something to do with the center of gravity and the fact that it is not an SUV like the Y."
Thanks for the nice video. How about making a review of the standard range? I personally miss that. :-)
"As always a good and informative video. Are you thinking of reviewing the Tesla voice command? Once you learn the commands, they help a lot. For example, you could say ""set wiper speed to 2"", or ""Im freezing"", or ""set the temperature to 21°"" or ""Navigate to Q-park Nørreport"" or ""Set side screen"". There are many more to choose from..."
"Got a China LR a couple of weeks ago. Have had a good long trip of 1,800 km now and think the dampers are very comfortable. So wondering if your test car is a 22 model? Perhaps you have explained it in the video and I have not caught it :-)"
Super good review Jesper
"I have one like this and have driven 30,000 km in it. I mostly agree with your considerations. If I were to buy today, I would 100% buy the exact same car."
"Thanks for the input, I love your videos and Jimmy rosa, Ive had ioniq 5 before, driven many times id4 and Skoda enyaq, now I own a model Y from the end of February 2023, I think you should try the new model Y from Berlin, Undercarriage is fantastic and with the last software update I dont experience any problem with the lights and wipers. My old ioniq 5 costs 460k today, something I would never exchange my model Y for."
"Hello... the black Y you show here is from Giga Berlin. You can see it i.a. on double stitching on the front seats and in the trunk, you can see it in the sides where the plastic stops on both sides up by the hat shelf. Shanhai models do not have double stitching on the front seats, and the plastic behind the hat shelf runs around and down the middle on both sides"
"Hi, thanks for a nice video and good review. you can actually buy a ""speedometer"" display that can easily be mounted in front of the steering wheel, the one Ive seen looks fine and has a lot of information"
Good and honest video. The black model Y you drive without P sensors actually has the new chassis.
"Thanks for another great video. After test driving the Model Y Long Range I was honestly a bit disappointed. It has some clear advantages that make it hard to get around, but I expected a better quality cabin as well as better comfort."
"Thanks for a couple of excellent videos that have convinced me that we are not yet ready to switch to EVs. We keep our ICE, and hope that the researchers will soon be ready with environmentally friendly batteries that provide better range and charging speed."
"Hello Jesper. Are you sure the software is up to date? You came out with an update around Christmas, and after that I think automatic dimming works almost perfectly. Rain sensor not so munc"
"The ultimate Tesla review. Im quite surprised that rain sensor, automatic lights, sign recognition, lane assist. is so poor. I probably shouldnt ask to be driven around driverless in one like that"
"Hi ! How to start the year off right! Fortunately everything is in order. Thank you for the video, its good to know how it goes in a case like yours. I too would have thought that everything would be done with home insurance… like what, we learn something every day"
"Thank you for the presentation of your incident, which ends well all the same. All the best ."
"Hello to you 2, I also had the right to my first observation, during our ski vacation on February 15 (and 10 minutes from leaving, voluntary degradation by a woman of my drivers door) Same as you for the procedure, I am at Allianz, same expertise by vision and email file, except that in the end it did not fit either with the amount of the bodybuilder, 1500€ against barely 1000€ for the expert, rectify afterwards phone call between the 2, in the end my vehicle will be taken care of by the tesla approved bodywork in Lyon at the beginning of April, but it is necessary when the visit of the expert to really quantify the damage to avoid ending up with an amount remaining at my charge, immobilized for 3 days, concerning the laying of ceramics, is it taken care of for you?"
Very well and good luck...
"More fear than harm in the title of the video, the obstacle course with insurance precisely, I watched a video of Teslaventure during the week where he talks about his insurer, an instructive video, good WE"
"Case well done, it will regain all its beauty"
Was the refitting of the ceramic covered by the insurance?
"Hello, for information, the gate of the house has closed on the car, it is the owners home insurance that has been set up. Everything went well, €100 deductible for the owner. Report made and sent to his insurance.. the insurance reimbursed us for all of the work estimates without the deductible. (just pc ar)"
And suddenly you will have a penalty or not afterwards?
"Bad luck, the same mishap happened at a roundabout, a badly fixed scaffolding element and in windy weather fell on the front and broke the bumper. Body parts get expensive fast..."
"Thank you for your honest video. We have also been driving MY LR since the beginning of December and are generally satisfied. The lack of sensors and the information policy bother us the most. The other points you mentioned affect us less, since we drive relatively little AB."
Thank you for your honesty. I think its great to mention the negative things. Please continue.
Thank you for your honest opinion! Am retired and id3 driver. My wife and I are happy with our decision!
Finally an honest opinion
"As a Model Y driver, I can only agree with you on all points."
"Did you give your consent to take over the car without parking sensors, if so when and where?"
"I drove almost 7000 kilometers in 5 months, yes the car is not perfect, but for €50,000 you dont have to raise expectations that much, nothing in the world is perfect, my dad bought the glc for 90k and there are other problems I recommend the m3 or MY used to you, the costs are not too much anymore, I’ve already seen offers for €30-35k"
I hope you find something better
Every small car has USS: My Škoda Enyaq model year 2023 also has no beeper and no reversing camera. But Ive never missed Hamburg either.
"The ""electronic"" noises, squeaks, etc. come from the drive unit. Many others also report this, but it only occurs after a few thousand kilometers. The noise shouldnt have been there to begin with, right? My Tesla is currently only 2000 KM down and has not yet."
"No car is perfect and no manufacturer is perfect. Phantom brakes are available from all manufacturers, bad service, poor quality, poor service and long times for spare parts as well. If you want a higher-quality interior, such as in the BMW i4, you will have to pay a few (tens of) thousands more. Otherwise, look at the rant videos on the EQS from Car Maniac or the videos on Schmidtkos Ioniq 5 at Electric Dave or the delivery drama of the Polestar 2 at Bloghaus or the experiences with the ID.3 at Battery Life or the ID.4 or that eTron 55 by Dirk Himmelmann. All manufacturers are under pressure regarding costs and spare parts and software errors."
"Never use Tesla assistance systems on construction sites. Is also in the BDA. I used to drive the e-Golf with all the assistance systems. This is suicidally implemented. Not a beep when the e-Golf drives off track and it follows diagonal shadows. In contrast, Tesla has been driving for 3.5 years, as if on rails, whether in the tunnel, in the rain or in the blazing sunlight."
Simply short and sweet the Tesla MY destroys wonderfully
"Its great that someone without rose-colored Tesla glasses reports. The elimination of the USS sensors without an adequate replacement is a joke and everyone who thinks that the Elon brings the super software solution ""over the air"" can hardly be helped anyway.... Cant imagine how great the Tesla product would be if the management also had social skills and would listen to customers and employees"
"Modern refrigerants have solved the ozone depletion problem. However, current generation refrigerants used in heat pumps (R-410a, R-32, etc) still have a Global Warming Potential (GWP) that are hundreds of times greater than CO2. If your HVAC system catastrophically leaks out, youve more or less blown your entire carbon budget for the year. Therefore, high quality workmanship when installing a minisplit heat pump is critical. Upcoming generations of refrigerants will solve this problem, but they arent at commercial scale yet."
I dig it…this product will create tremendous savings for homeowners and all facets of property ownership.
"i have a heat pump in my home already, it works great even at -10f to keep the house at 70, but if it gets colder out not so much. to get better efficiency in really cold temps geothermal heat pumps need to come to play."
"$0.3T is $300 billion, cost for the heat pumps, not $30 billion. Still an economically okay cost in comparison."
"Interesting. There is already a big block of business manufacturing and installing heat pumps all over the place. They are already a no-brainer if you are looking at long-term return on investment for the home-owner, whether retrofitting an existing forced air gas/oil/electric forced air system, replacing baseboards, or building new. I think that they must see opportunity in the commercial environment (ie office, factory, institutional, etc), though Im not sure..."
"The world is definitely ready to switch to heat pumps. They are already in wide use in many countries, especially those without gas lines running all over the place. Heat pumps reduce the cost of heating a home if you have electric heat, by 66 percent, and 33 percent if you have oil or gas. With Teslas heat pump, which will no doubt be more efficient, the savings will be greater."
"When you think that theres not much heat at say zero degrees F, and therefore not much heat energy available to add to your 65 degree house to heat it, you may be forgetting that any temperature above -460 F has available heat. And that zero degrees outside has a huge amount of heat compared to -460F and with the proper machinery, all of that heat is available to move inside. A similar argument works in the other direction to cool your house, though with different numbers."
Heat pumps YES - but only with quality insulation in our structures
In localities that dont freeze Im surprised no one has developed a heat pump/AC that uses water as the closed loop refrigerant. Second best is mixtures of synthetic propane and butane for practical metallic components. In theory you could have a unit block with fins on top and bottom that has no hoses and could be laser welded for complete hermetic seal -- it would work for a roof or wall installation were hoses would be superfluous. But of course hoses can move the heat sink/source to where you want it and isolate motor noise. Heat pumps also work well for cloths dryers and water distillers.
The heat pump is just an inverted fridge ! where the inside of the fridge is the outside of the house and the radiator is inside the house.
"Pretty much everyone I know that transitioned to heat pumps have replaced them with standard units, they didnt work."
"Heat pumps have been around for decades. Theyve been getting better over the years as well. Present day heat pumps can achieve a coefficient of performance (COP) of 5. This translates to 500% efficiency. Very impressive, but heat pump COP drops as the temperature difference (inside air temp - outside air temp) increases. So... when it is relatively warm outside (say 55 deg F) the heat pump can put lots of power (in the form of heat energy) in your house efficiently (even though you dont need all that much power on a 55 deg F day). However, at 10 deg F day, the heat pumps COP is significantly lower... maybe 3? (not sure on the exact numbers here). This is fundamental to the way heat pumps operate. So, when you really need lots of power (in the form of heat) coming into your house, the heat pump delivers less power. At some point, the power needed is below what the heat pump can provide. this is where resistive heating comes in. Resistive heating is effectively a COP of 1. In this case the electricity requirement increase significantly. Designing a heat pump system for a house is an exercise in finding a right size solution. Interestingly, when a cold spell hits, your electricity demand can really jumps. So the grid needs to handle the worst case heating requirement. This will generally occur at night, which is also the time most folks will be charging their cars. So... as we increase to 50% or more EV adoption, we will want to charge our EVs at night, but if the weather forecast is for really cold temperatures, we may want to postpone EV charging until the next day. Funny how these things work out!"
"2:54 - 300B, not 30B."
If Tesla made one competitively priced that worked well in MN I would buy it today.
I hope he does and soon. My ground source heat pump is 15 years old.
Tesla/Musk just announced a custom planned/built community for GigaTexas employees - seems like the logical place for prototypes to be installed and tested!
"Excellent, excellent video, because it really helped me understand how Teslas heat compact heat pump system works!"
Excellent video! Thanks
Making money is an action. Keeping money is behavior. Growing money is knowledge..
Im so pumped.
"Which 1,000 HP car would you rather be driving? Turbo S or X?"
Always a pleasure doing videos with you! Thanks for featuring our Turbo S!
"Not only that, first race Porsche upshifted too early about half way through the race. Would have had him like the third race otherwise"
telsa dude took the W and ran. LOL. cant blame him though... the porsche mucked up the first 2 runs with shifting. wonder if itd do better just leaving in full auto.
One of the most insane races you’ve ever posted.
"I have to say - Dragtimes has one of the friendliest comments sections amongst the car-YouTubers! Usually, when EVs and ICE battle, the comments section is a warzone, filled with hate toward one anothers favorite car or technology."
Let’s face it. The Model X is a glorified Minivan. Absolutely insane that it is beating a modified 911 Turbo like that.
"Awesome video, very entertaining as always"
Thank you Brooks for sharing all your time and videos and your crew god bless All of you
Great content thanks as always!
I can’t wait to see Brooks start to put Lucid Sapphires up against everything.
The X has grown on me looks wise. Think Id still pick an S though
Great case study of everything from therapeutic to supraphysiological levels of TRT.
I love all this telemetry Brooks puts up on screen. Break it down for me bruh!!
The recent price drops for the S and X suggest new more powerful models are coming soon (remember when the P100D dropped to $94K just before the Plaids came out). So what comes after Plaid? Plaid+ maybe? That would help compete against the Lucid Air Sapphire.
"I own the same blue MXP but totally expected it to lose easily to the Porsche given the specs. The trap speed on the MXP was consistently low by about 5 mph. Was it wet and cold in addition to overcast? One excuse the Teslas never need to make is the ""missed shift"" or ""botch launch""."
"Model x plaids with 80-90 SOC usually run 9.7-9.8 at over 140mph , any reason why this one ran slower times?"
Damn that turbo s looks sexy! Wish i could afford one. Edit: the guy with the porsche should get it modified by 9ff.
"""Gotta go to Whole Foods"" Its literally a grocery getter"
That was a great race man.. I went for the Porsche for the win.
"Was a fairly quiet week after a huge Investor Day the week prior...go enjoy your weekend with your family and friends OR by yourself, sometimes thats good too!"
"Thanks for including my CyberTruck video. A couple of things: I don’t know for sure that the performance version will be tri motor instead of quad, but I’m pretty confident based on feedback from staff."
"Great video as always, thanks :) That being said, Cybertruck even at $80K would IMO be a giant flop considering the design is supposed to make manufacturing cheaper. Of course prices have changed since $40K CT was announced, but prices for M3/MY have definitely not doubled since then."
"You do great shows. Concise, relevant and to the point. Thank you and best wishes."
Much appreciated Dillon. Wishing you and Ashley have a great weekend.
Super bummed about 6 seats getting dropped from Cybertruck. May push me to the R1S
It looks amazing now that it is smaller. I would buy a slightly smaller version with no bed but hatch back style.
"Sad to hear the Cybertruck will not have the center front seat. Smaller width is not a good excuse, since there still is three across seating in back."
Only very bad news before the arrival of the Cybertruck
Personally I’m going to wait until we get the information from Tesla. Not completely convinced that what he’s saying is correct.
Cybertruck in house accessories - hope they make a paddle or fin that snaps onto wheels for water passages!
Clip on paddle wheel hubcaps for boating might be a option.
"Long term bull, but do have a couple concerns: 1) DBE 4680s are far from full ramp and thats the main reason CT is way behind schedule. Since nickel is required for CT 4680s, if Tesla was indeed positive they were on track to solve DBE production at mass scale, they wouldve already inked a deal with Indonesia for massive nickel contracts. Its also concerning that the few MYs they produce using non-DBE 4680s only get 279 miles of range, while the model using 2170s gets 330 miles, meaning that even if the can fully ramp DBE 4680s, theyll still need to tweak the chemistry to get the higher energy density needed for the CT."
"As much as i love this truck design and engineering , I think i will pass as I was really wanting a 6 seater. Ill save up for a used Model X instead."
Where did you hear that the lightbar at the top of the windshield will make it to production? This would be so awesome
It’s things like this that make me think sometimes maybe China is more involved than we are.
"The question doesnt ask if they think it ""is real"" which what you said - it asks if they think it is ""a real truck"" - subtle difference on paper, but its a different question. One question is asking about existence; the other is asking subjectively if you think it will perform like (what respondents consider) a real truck."
"The original dual-motor Cybertruck was originally announced at $50k. The estimate of $80k to $100k would be a HUGE miss, 60% to 100% over, and WAY beyond the total amount of inflation since then, with the design sticking rather close to what was originally announced.)"
"I encourage you, and others, to stop using the term “misinformation”. Was saying the same thing to friends the other night. BYD saying that the Tesla cars is not misinformation or misleading. They’re lies and should be labeled as such. Small pet peeve of mine and the verbiage is pervasive in todays society."
If it is true about no opening between cab and truck bed I believe that is a huge mistake I t could have provided real uniqueness to this vehicle and provided many opportunities for owners to be creative with their Cybertruck I remember listing it as my number 1 anticipated possible feature in a survey Oh Well
"Chuck; you’re the perfect person for this. Patient, detail oriented, and a great communicator. Keep up the great work."
So grateful you guys are doing all this hard work. Kudos.
"At the road ranger, the path planner began showing it was going to go around just as you disengaged. FSD needs to be better at communicating its intentions in these scenarios, and it needs to do so sooner to provide confidence."
Another solid video. Your nuanced observations are very helpful. Thx!
"Love the rain! Your recording equipment would be great to record some amsr or whatever, sound videos. I never know which ones to listen too. Thunder storms are great!"
Wondering if a larger group of people will get the update to V11 this weekend. Seems mostly fine. Like no major bugs. I really want that option to limit lane changes to obstacles and to follow route.
Thank you for your continuous content!
Good job Chuck as usual ….
"Thank you Chuck. Your the tester I to go to for your dispassionate assessment. Chuck, could you at the end of one of your posts, review and discuss all your new FSD settings you have for Version 11. It may be useful for some us after wider roll out takes place. Thanks"
The failure to go to the left most lane at 20:54 is probably due to the solid white line.
"Hi Chuck, Do you notice any phantom breaking on the single stack drives as compared to the older builds?"
"Thanks Chuck. Good challenge to the route planner and lane complications. We all have some similar. Question: I noticed many times that you keep your Navigation Point on ""N"" (North) as opposed to the direction of travel (where I keep mine). Is there a reason for your preference? Thanks."
Until this mornings video I had not had the chance to watch in a long time. I can see a lot of changes since then. The graphics are great! Nice job Tesla team.
"13:40 Regardless of FSD Beta or any other software you get with a Tesla, I am shocked they still havent implemented a lane adjacent traffic aware cruise control setting. There is a street on the main leg into town where I live where this is the most common accident during rush hour."
"Thanks for the video Chuck. I felt second hand tension going through the interchanges with those quirky speed changes. Regarding your comment at 8:20; I understand the point you are making. The reality is that law enforcement has failed to do its job enforcing speed limits to such a degree for so long, the average driver treats a speed limit as a speed floor. Some people actually get upset at a driver who is driving the speed limit. It is an absurdity to think that autonomous driving software should intentionally speed as humans do, and yet, if it doesnt, it can create a ""dangerous"" situation as you say... Although Id argue habitual speeding is what creates the dangerous environment. Until speed limits are actually enforced at the posted speed, autonomous vehicles obeying speed limits are going to be wrongfully thought of as problematic."
Have you noticed any changes in the meeting traffic on narrow-ish road scenario?
"Great video, Regarding your comment at 3.30  regarding the speed offset. I was from your prior profil setting, which stays if you change profile midt drive. To get all profile settings you must change the profile setting while in park."
Just arrived in Jacksonville. In your neighborhood. Staying overnight downtown before I head back to GA. Glad to see unprotected left turn video. Can’t wait to get the update myself.
Ambulance indicator would make sense. Also use a monocromatic Red car symble on the screen that are other Teslas running on auto pilot or FSDbeta. This should help being calm in heavy traffic just knowing where the other intelligent cars are in proximity.
"8:45 I hope it wasnt phantom braking for that vehicle getting into your lane ahead of you? Because if it was, that is some pretty bad range estimation to think you were about to crash into him...."
"Click here  and use code NYK to get $5 off Magic Spoon’s deliciously healthy cereal, happiness guaranteed!"
It is utterly painful how underappreciated you guys are & the significant work your channel is doing to spread overall EV awareness.
"I like this, because it allows market to play out. If Tesla offers a superior product, the other charging stations will go away if they can’t catch up with the ease and reliability of Tesla. I love the fact they’re opening this up it will continue to prove their product for charging, they will be the gas station of the future market will decide"
After seeing the full investor day I have complete faith in the Tesla team. Im sure whatever decisions they make are clearly thought and weighed.
Great information in a very friendly easy to understand way. Thank you very much. Great move by Tesla for the world
Good discussion of the effects of opening some superchargers to non-Tesla vehicles.
"Would have been helpful to see the actuals on the European charger adoption curve. Tesla must have gotten a sense of the percentages from that testing. In any case, I agree that Teslas buildout of SC will be mind numbingly exponential. If they believe their 20M per year number, then the SC buildout would have to be suitably proportional."
"As a frequent visitor to the Brewster NY Supercharger now with Magic Dock, I agree with many of your points. It was also fun to record video of other EV owners there. Magic Dock and Magic Spoon, was that planned ;)"
"Great video guys !! The stats do not account for users with Tesla home chargers, if you have the option, this is the better. more scalable option. I would bet a cold beer than Tesla has the data to make a good determination. Id be curious about the weighting of home charging vs SuperCharging as you stated. Kudos!!"
The idea that should of been part of the discussion is when will the system to support EV charging be completed in the United States? I would think EV range anxiety will be a thing of the past once the charging infrastructure has been compete. The transition to a gasoline service infrastructure only took about ten years from 1908 to 1918.
Thanks Jack and Jesse for your information. The only thing missing in your assessment is that the other EV’s will take 2 to 3 stalls for charging their vehicles. This will impact tremendously the availability for Tesla owners to charge their cars. Hope that Tesla have arranged their magic docks in a way that it doesn’t impact Tesla owners.
"Excellent post, and really well researched, as usual. good stuff."
"Great video. I have owned my 2019 Model X since the middle of 2019 and only used the Superchargers on the original drive from the east coast to Az. Since then twice I have had to stop in and plug in, otherwise all my charging is done at home. I have to believe many like me hardly ever use the Tesla Suoercharger unless venturing out from home. So having other use the system wont really effect my enjoyment of the car."
I think anything that helps transportation go electric is valuable. Not only is the availability of chargers valuable ( I want more) but the speed of charging in a tesla is of value. Love our model 3.
"Win/ win situations are most always good. I’m glad that soon I’ll be able to drive to places I can’t just now. My wife and I own a 2021 Chevy Bolt, and here out west there are not a lot of fast chargers, except Tesla super chargers. Yes, most of them are on an interstate highway, but no problem, the interstate system goes most everywhere in the US. That said, as you stated, a lot of hotels have level 2 chargers for an overnight charge. We have stayed in a few already"
"I like your numbers. I can see that you have done your homework and came up with some realistic estimations. It’s impossible to know precisely since there is just too many unknown variables but I would agree with your estimates for the most part. What I didn’t realize is how beneficial this will be for Tesla and after listening to this episode I would once again agree with your assessment. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this, it really helps us to understand the impact of the unfolding events."
It makes perfect sense to me for Tesla to open up their network to other EVs…. It will definitely help the transition to EVs and lessen range anxiety for all drivers. I love their magic dock idea!! Also as an investor I believe this is the right move!
I agree almost anything you said. And great job with the analysis. I think Tesla won’t touch the existing locations too much. Maybe few remote areas will be useful for non-Tesla since there is no CCS chargers there.
I live in Roseville CA and have driven a M3P since 12/2019. I have waited for a supercharger 2 times for a total of 10 mins in that time. I wait longer in Sam’s Club gas pump lines. The SC station count has increased significantly since I bought mine and I am sure that the money they are getting will be invested into accelerating making more and more SC stations. Time will tell.
Great Video Guys. One of the biggest advantages Tesla has is the data. They have more data about the different cars and charging than any other company probably more than all the other companies combined. So they will be able to react to this build-out and control it so it will get them the federal $$ and be the best experience for all. I am not saying there will be some bumps in the road. But this just makes sense. I think Tesla looks at the amount of time the charges are used and more utilization for Tesla means more return on the investment. So this should be good for all.
Let Tesla and Elon Musk know what youd like to see in the NEW Model Y for 2024 in the COMMENTS below!
I cant believe the Model Y is already getting a refresh. 2020 wasnt that long agi!
A middle screen would be nice!
Does this mean prices will come down for the consumer?
MY ASS ~ behind the wheel till I can afford the semi eh!?!!5:30Pm3/10/2023
ALL the banks that are carrying car loans are going to be in trouble now too.
Thanks for the great info Rob. And thanks for not trying to sell me crap while doing it!
"Rob, you missed the insider trading in the last 6 weeks that sparked the bank run. The CEO led, but every SVB officer was selling Titanic-size tranches (which means slices en Francais)."
Some much valuable information! We all appreciate you
"Q: how much of SVBs woes came from contagion from Chinese banks and borrowers? I have the suspicion its nonzero. China is suffering its own banking crisis, and I dont think it will remain confined to China."
"Could reduced model 3 output in China be caused by a ""test line"" to try out unboxed manufacturing methods? They DID pause to ""upgrade"", right?"
"Wouldn’t put it past the big banks to tell their VC connections to move all money away from SVB and make it fail, they immediately take a small reactive hit but they invite all retail savings to come back to the big banks that pay misery interests and at the same time they telegraph to the Fed what happens if they continue to raise rates, big banks would be using the requirements for liquidity imposed on them post 2008 as a weapon. I mean… it’s not like these guys care about fleeing deposits to smaller/higher yield regional banks, right???"
key point u showed was cash in banks not all insured. hope none of teslas banks fail.
"Rob, I have 2 bookmarks for your vids, ""Live"" and ""Videos"". Neither give me your most recent posts consistently, so I check both of them daily because I dont like missing your reports. Im just letting you know in case others have this issue and if youve noticed anything strange about this. Thanks for your ""service""."
When talking about depositor concentration risk I think you missed the real source of the problem. In normal times SVB would have had plenty of liquidity because there would have been net capital inflows from new VC investments in startups. But the VC market has almost dried up over the past nine months which meant that SVB had a net outflow of deposits as their customers burned through their startup capital. They needed to liquidate their bond portfolio at a loss to cover the outflows and the market got wind of it and that was the end.
Do we know if Tesla had any accounts at SVB?
"Well, if fed raising interest rates doesnt cause enough unemployment, they can just raise it until all of the banks fail... thats one way of doing it."
"Nice due diligence on Teslas Cash & Cash equivalents on their Balance Sheet,"
The VIX was spicy today.
If they have a portfolio of bonds then they lose value when interest rates increase.
SVB Asset value is same as Morgan Stanley. This will give us an idea of the enormity of this collapse
The Fed running out of AMMO as well

Excelent as always. Thomas is good a holiday break we await your return
Interesting and elegant. Thank you very much for the delivery!
Excellent summary!!! It is learned. And a lot! A big greeting from Buenos Aires!!
Well done Thomas 🇪🇸
I want Thomas back please
new subscriber
Very very good looking! But what a price!!!! In a few years we wont be able to drive...
Thomas explains the videos much better and gives a nicer picture. The cost of the car is unaffordable for the middle class.
They do not say how long it takes to do 0 to 100 or the maximum speed
Greetings from Brooklyn ny a new subscriber
and Thomas?? Alright?? Something has happened? All the best
It can compete with the MODEL S PLAiD I dont think so
The price. I dont have loose...
"It reminds me of the oldsmobile aurora, its hard to create a platform from scratch, the rest is blah blah, Teslas look like Mazdas,"
Wheres Thomas...
"I dont know who had the bad idea of ​​calling it that ""Lucid Air"" when pronounced it seems that you say ""lucifer"" and I think that name needs no introduction. The same thing happened when Audi released the ""Q3"" in Spain that seems to say Audi ""crappy""."

Thank you daily Marca for posting this video. This topic of electric cars is interesting. Thank you so much.
"Incredible technology!, very good video!"
"Right now it is at 1 million pesos, it is still expensive but it is totally worth it"

"Excellent video! Without having crazy edits, or many camera angles, you offer the best information and that is the most valuable."
"wow, very good video, the technology is impressive"
Thank you for such interesting information.....
"How much would the real autonomy of 580km of the Model 3 have, a great autonomy on the highway at a speed of 120-130km/h?"
"If it is one of the best sellers, it is for one reason only: the cargo network. Because having to check the car 100% when picking it up to detect faults in the assembly of parts is something that cries out to heaven for a car of 50,000 euros. It should be the dealer who fully checks it before delivery to confirm that everything is correct."
Its my favorite car even though I dont have a license
"With a 75kw battery, I would need to spend 12.9 kW/100 km to do 580 km... It seems to me that it consumes a little more... Being realistic and thats all right, about 400 to 450 km can be done"
White upholstery and 35 kg dogs in a sedan... what a great idea!
"Well, you should also worry about security because for 50,000 little you have I saw the other day a video that broke in half and on top of that it caught fire, too bad the death of the person who inhabited that tesla"
"In particular, I do not like that everything is controlled through the screen."
"Well. It will be for the next life, as long as we have the happiness of being born with money."

"The door handles flush with the bodywork have been carried by the same planes for many years ago... Min 0:59 and the car is all electronic and computer, it is full of sensor cables, screens and all kinds of electronic circuitry and digital, they have only changed the piston engine for all that I have mentioned, apart from its high empty weight it sacrifices autonomy and payload, the price is certainly not affordable for many working class and apart from that it is not useful for me to do trips of 900 km, with such a set of sensors, modules and so on, it is not possible to repair by oneself the faults that it could have compared to the cars of yesteryear that were manufactured to be durable and that the owner himself could repair it, if I have to pay electricity to recharge the same as to refuel gasoline we are in the same as with gasoline cars"
Its going exactly as some of us thought. The fact that these OEMs are just realizing it now shows how far behind they really are.
"When Musk speaks, he speaks like a visionary; when these guys speak, I hear a lot of double-talk. I hear people that dont have the answers. I hear people who have been caught with their pants down and I see people who arriving at the prom while the cool kids have already left and are going to the after-party."
Props to the humility and respect the CEO was showing to his currently greatest rival of Tesla while not backing down!
they are scared. Musk is a formidable opponent.
"Tough for the automakers because they are going against the most incredible person on the planet (Elon of course), not just another company like Rivian or Lucid, etc."
"As an investing enthusiast, I often wonder how top level investors are able to become millionaires off investing. I do have a significant amount of capital that is required to start up but I have no idea what strategies and direction I need to approach to help me make decent returns"
"If Ford doesn’t scale their EV’s sooner, they are in deep doodoo! Once the CT is in production scale. They are going to be in a world of hurt! Tesla CyberVan is on its way as well!"
"The defeatist body language on the Ford team says ""we know weve already lost and theres no way we can compete in the EV market because of our culture, wrong talent, limited technical knowledge, and unions"". You know youre in trouble when your CEO (Farley) shifts in his chair and says ""but were #1 in EV minivans"". Thats grasping for straws!"
"The Ford Team looks very uncomfortable, but kudos to them from coming and participating. Farley and Ford can rebound from this if they work at it. I think they have a better chance than GM or Dodge, but its going to be tough. Their biggest liability currently is their dealer network and it will kill off more customers than it supports if they arent careful. Farleys ""we have 90% of the electric vans"", is funny as it would appear that Tesla is about to make a van and the Rivian van is amazing. If Rivian can figure out how to get its production up, they will be a huge threat to Ford on vans. Good discussion and I like to see them a bit uncomfortable."
They don’t look too confident
Thank you for this wonderful video! I have incurred so much losses trading on my own....I trade well on demo but I think the real market is manipulated.... Can anyone help me out or at least tell me what Im doing wrong?
Musk went balls deep into the automotive industry with no lube. Every other company is in agony right now.
"Interesting to hear all of this from the CEO of Ford, Ford is aiming for 2 million EV in 2026. Tesla will likely be there this year. I am hoping that they make it."
"You have to love Sandy, hes very humble."
"its funny, Im pretty sure that the people who are dissing Tesla and all things electric in general are the exact same people who were saying that smoking was healthy back in the 70s."
Screwed the pooch at the end. Covering up Sandy’s face when he obviously was choked up at the accolades he was getting. What a shame we couldn’t see that.
"EV adoption is following a perfect S-curve, same as every other technology including the switch from horse and buggy to the car over 100 years ago...... Which model are these guys using to forecast???"
Hey remember that one time Apple ceo didn’t even take a meeting with Elon . I always wondered if Steve Jobs would have !!??
I drive an F150 and I really hope Ford survives. Unfortunately a LOT of the other car makers may not. Its too little too late and I think GM will be the first to go.
I know two Ford Lightning owners. I think they would be totally happy if they had a better charging app for the phone and a real charging network for trips. I think trucks are the key to Ford if they cant make the cheapest EV for normal people.
Give your opinion about something I read to you!!!
"Good morning, super mega happy, with all my respect I remember a video of you. 1.- I think I remember a video where if they dont let you charge in a hotel youll be stranded. 2.- I dont remember if it was 2 or 3 months waiting for a replacement Headlight. 3.- Autopilot failures (this one quite recent I would say where he takes you against a truck."
"I like your videos because of your sincerity, your experience is good because you tell it, how much is the price of charging the battery? All the best"
Im glad youre doing well with the Sezar trolley: Regards
"For me it would be a dream to have it, enjoy it friend, greetings from Malaga, and of course the electric one is already a present, TESLA yesterday manufactured the 4,000,000 M car so that some will find out."
"I have a 2018 model S and I am super happy, and I have a 9% battery degradation and I have never been left stranded."
"They already missed more, videos of trips in the Tesla. Thank you!"
"Regarding the ""loss of autonomy"" of the battery, Tesla explained to me that it was not a loss, but that the car calculates how long the battery will last with your most usual consumption, it gets used to your routines. Its what they told me, whether its true or not, only they know."
It can or cannot be done depending on your time and the charging network where you are.
"Id like to see when that car reaches 200,000 km! And how will it come xD I have a 23-year-old car with almost 400K kilometers. Maintenance per year barely reaches €100, I doubt that any Tesla or electric can say the same. Regards!"
Good video. To continue enjoying the car and the good gastronomy.
I have to tell you that sleeping in a garage is not the same as sleeping in the street...totally different...in the street the battery would be like a strawberry ice cream
The interesting thing would have been to know the consumption going up the Alto de los Leones. I am very mountaineering
"Good video Sezar, I live in Stockholm and at temperatures of -10 it is quite noticeable, but hey, winter in Madrid during the day gives a breather. we keep learning"
"On Saturday I leave for Bucares Romania from Madrid about 3100 kilometers, about 30 hours more or less and about 300 euros between gasoline and LPG. Question, how many weeks does it take with the tesla and how long does it take to plan a trip like this?"
Greetings from the Canary Islands. Thanks for the video and very well explained.
"It is good for me to see how your electric car turns out over time, since I live far from civilization and I doubt that I can have an electric one. For now, my trips are 2100 km... At least six times a year. Patagonian greetings"
"My question is... if the car at the start, with the battery at full capacity, tells you that you can do 396 km, and when you spend 45% of battery you should have done a minimum of 178.2 km, which is much more than the 129 you have done ....electric cars are useless, in my opinion, to cover unforeseen events and you have to have everything well planned and, most importantly, with time....but I really like your videos and I have been following you for a long time in your two channels...great content!!!"
"Its very good and it would be good for me every day at work, doing about 65 km a day. Now, I still think that for a long trip, it is still in its infancy."
"To be fair and compare with the Ángel Gaitán video (you were referring to him hehe) well, you should have left the car in the street since the Gaitán video spent the whole night at about -5C. You cant compare having the battery at 12 from the garage with -5. It would also be necessary to see the average speed of the 2 since angel does not say it but surely it was not going to 120 but a little more"
Great video on the latest Y.
Great review! Beautiful car
"The Matrix LED headlights are in the Performance model only, correct? Or are they now standard in the LRs too? thanks!"
"I was wondering how come the blue paint is soo good. Then I saw the ccs port, that’s when I realized it must be made in Germany"
"Top Notch Video, Keep It up, I love the Video. The New Model Y is really Gorgeous"
Excellent video bro this video is so nice detail and all
How long does it take to Auto lock the door when you get out of the car?
I thought the quicksilver colour was only available in Europe. How did you get one in America??
"So when does this version come out with quick silver coming out? Also, this has the upgraded cameras does it have hardware 4? Where was this located that you were able to see this?"
"It does NOT have updated 5.1 mp cameras. Those are not yet on the marked for Tesla, but will be later with HW4.0"
"felt like watching tesla tutorials again, do you work for tesla or something"
You inaccurately quoted a max range of 330 miles. This is the performance Y which has a 303 mile range.
Thank you very informative video
Speaking speech pacing is great.thank you.
Nice
"Tesla changed the way of driving, which is risky actually on road if you get used to traditional driving"
"This is the model y performance model. The brakes are ceramic? I didnt know that. I just received mine and just never know when the car is completely off. Sometimes in the morning, it appears the heater is on and car is already warm. I think its been going all night because the battery has gone down 4%."
I prefer the plastic over the soft carpet. The plastic was higher quality imo
Seems like the perfect car for a homeless person!
Good salute
"You are making me want to buy one, but the Model 3. Since Tesla is changing its models frequently, could you do a test of the current Model 3? To see if the finishes and braking resistance have improved."
"Wonderful, it would be a dream to have one. I would like to add a point in favor that it has compared to a Model 3 that justifies the price difference a little more. Off-road mode. Supposedly, with this mode the car is able to emulate a differential lock with the brakes and is more responsive when crossing bridges than other Teslas without this mode. Of course, it is not designed to be off-road with it, but that it has the capabilities is a hoot."
"Great video and test, as always. The car, I dont know if it will be the future but a long transition to whatever. Greetings."
"A small mistake, Teslas V2 superchargers are the ones that give 150kw. The V3 that give 250kw"
"Its too beautiful, it even has my initial, its a beautiful dream, my favorite color, it seems to be made for me"
"Good video Mr. Dalmau, everything very well exposed, personally I dont like the interior or exterior design, but if it goes as well as you say, thats the important thing"
"At last! Great job Joan! Have I detected a certain effusiveness when describing his driving? Hehehe, it has been noticed that it came from within and this gives it a touch of realism that sometimes others lack."
As engineering a real pass.
"I dont like the electric ones at all, but I must point out that seeing them in person and not being so used to seeing them, they impress me in a certain way (also knowing what they are capable of performance-wise) although it is true with the aforementioned shortcoming of their autonomies. Joan, I already told you that I love the screensaver of your mobile (from my most favorite brand); Could it be from a FERRARI 812 SUPERFAST? Great review as always.-"
"Congratulations again Joan, a true mastery in videos of more than cars. There are detractors of the brand.... is the price really justified? Despite the minimalism of the brand... I dont see it. Happy Holidays."
It would be great to make a comparison between the 4 Tesla vehicles! Good video!
What other similar models would you compare it to?
"Thanks John. Excellent video, as always!"
"Great video, you are a great team, long live Spain."
Mr. Dalmau it is never too late if the wait is good Psdt the car Buff cannot be seen
"What I like about Tesla is how discreet it is, it is not as flashy as others, although if I bought one it would be the model 3"
You should rectify the regenerative brake. It can be graduated on the screen and even removed. In the video it is reflected as if or if it is always like that and it is not.
"I was half convincing myself until at the end of the video an announcement of the ev6 came out. And it has convinced me much more, in any case I believe that the current moment is that of a plug-in hybrid and personally for those prices I would stay with a new lexus nx plug-in hybrid. That by the way to see when you try it."
"A very complete video, yes sir. But that of not putting a sad instrumentation in front of the steering wheel or a head up display... a hug"
Can you make a ranking of cars between the quality it gives and its price?
"The model and performance, has 534 hp, in fact currently 06.2022 it has 562 hp, with a range of 514 km (WLTP) and weighs 1995 kg. The technical data of the video is from the first performance in the United States that came out."
Congratulations for the work you do!
"Wonderful. It has it all, although the price is not yet within the reach of all mortals."
"Tesla is above superchargers, but it is true that they still have to improve reliability, anyway if I had that money and going so well I would surely take it, excellent proof Mr. Dalmau."
That car is spectacular!!
"These speed bumps are regulated. If the city council does not regulate them, there is a state regulation that regulates them. Greetings and thanks for the video."
"It is still a very handsome car, and the wheels of the most beautiful of an electric, the Yankee And if it is well done, it is because in Europe we know how to build cars, even if they are American."
"Hello, first of all congratulations for the very complete test Second, I have read all the comments and you are amazed at how uninformed people are. I love cars and I have tried a Tesla model Y ""performance"" like this and FLIPASSS how it goes is just amazing..."
Thanks Joan for the video and information.
"Interesting product, can the third row seats be installed? Good video John."
"How thin Dalmau looks, excellent video, a well-deserved like"
Better sensations than a Taycan. You can value from one to 10 to each one. I dont know which one to buy.
Tesla is still tolerable why despite that bad deterioration of the interior we still brag about how beautiful they are
"Hello, your videos are spectacular as always, but just like they look well done, city, curves.... But..... Always during the day, I dont remember night driving tests for, for example, how the Tesla headlights look ... Because those of us who drive more often at night would like to know if this Tesla is safe at night due to its Led headlight system. Thank you."
"Dalmau, you have fallen in love again!!! From a Scalextric car!"
"It will be what it will be, but I havent seen Dalmau genuinely smiling at the cars reactions in a while."
We hope to see your test of the EV6 GT soon !! Greetings and excellent work!
"Yet another electric that is basically a silent computer on wheels. I understand that the acceleration and silence is attractive, but those of us who miss boards full of little buttons dont quite like it. Equally greetings :)"
"Not that Im a Tesla fan…. I like them a lot but I think that now Tesla will have to pay attention to after-sales, I think that with the factory in Berlin their quality claims will improve but now the second part is missing services"

"In 2019 my son asked me to watch this channel and learn about TSLA and the stocks. I watched and listened to SMR for about three weeks with my son. It was a type of education as I had never bought stocks in my life. I am so glad that I did as now I will have something that can be passed on to my son in his lifetime. The long game. I am not sure of the stock terms. I have continued to watch this channel off and on over the years and came across the AG1 also. I am almost at one month of taking this first thing in the morning and I couldnt be more thrilled as to how it makes me feel. Now, I vacuum and clean the house with headphones and dance while I work. I have the tunes on and dance along the shoreline. Of course, this is in areas that I wont be seen. lol, Steven has a wealth of information and I have not been steered wrong. AG1 and the only stocks I have are TSLA. Thanks, Steven and I am so glad that my son showed me your YouTube channel."

"Amazing videos and thank you for breaking it down!!<Despite the economic downturn, I’m so happy I have been earning $ 45,000 returns from my $8,000 investment every 14 days"
Hey Steven love these videoer where you are referring to teslas investor day. Make more of these please. Love your work
"I haven’t heard anybody talking about a little pill that Lars mentioned in his presentation when he described the assembly process of the next gen Tesla. He said “and then we will assemble all the pieces one time JUST LIKE CYBERTRUCK.” So the Cybertruck will be manufactured using the new process, 40% less space, etc."
Watched entire 4hr IDay real time but need to revisit. Got hell o lot out of it and still missed plenty.
"Theres a future conversation coming here around automation standards within Teslas current and near-term production capability. I think Berlin is circa 9000 staff with a target of 11/12k... the numbers Ive seen for proposed new roles in Mexico... seems to be around 6000-7000. So, many many more robots in the very near future, long before the tesla humanoid bot project delivers."
"Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!! Despite the economic downturn,Im so happy️. I have been earning $ 15,200 returns from my $7000 investment every 14days"
What I think is interesting is that the Mexico plant will be the biggest factory yet build the cheapest vehicle that has the smallest manufacturing footprint. Wonder what else will be built.
Are the recent GM buyouts significant or sop? Any info on difference in car accident repairs compared to ice vehicles? Reason why we allowed non-tesla to use the charging station on the early stage of ramp-ups? Feel we couldve pinched that supply off until later when its good philanthropy.
Video request: Lars statement “just like Cybertruck!” Please talk about how this unboxed approach is going to be applied to Cybertruck and what that could mean for Cybertruck costs and production speed! Thank you.
"Steven, Id love to see you on CNBS to challenge some of these analysts. How about it?"
Youve almost got me convinced to try AG1. I used to have an assembly line where I grew Kiefer at a rate of about a cup of really thick stuff every day. I used that in a morning smoothie with spinach and other things.
"Since the Next-Gen fab process requires less space, does anyone think it’s possible for Giga Texas to squeeze in a Next-Gen line? It would be awesome if we did not have to wait for the Mexico Giga factory. Thanks for the video."
Tesla are light years ahead - Elons obsession with efficiency and execution at every level is unprecedented. Even if companies knew how to copy this - they do not have the company culture & deep technical expertise that they can trust with budget. The way he has structured the company is truly under appreciated and one of his largest and effective achievements.
One of the best videos Ive ever seen. Thanks.
"I think the problem within the OEMs lies in the overcomplucated structures of those huge businesses. Maybe there were some ideas in the past quite similar to that, but those got denied. Huge corporations simply cannot move that fast like a ""small"" upstart where you can think completely new and beyond."
Interesting that Ive never seen GM or Ford show how they go through the assembly process. Guess they thought it would take too long. Kind of like turtles racing the rabbit but this time the rabbit has already won.
"As always, another great video. Jam packed with useful information presented in a succinct way. Thank You"
"I can understand keeping the design intact since the model 3 have a nice design but I hope they would atleast change the head and tail lights with an automatic frunk on the outside. On the inside they could do more, maybe ambient light, new steering and head up display."
"Changes to either model will be minor. Sure, a camera upgrade, new alloys/hubs and perhaps a few of the colour options to mirror Berlin. Maybe slight interior alterations. But Tesla doesnt want to slow production by making bigger changes."
"I really want them to keep the stock. It is one of my favorite features, and pairs well with my Mercedes Sprinter that has an identical gear selector."
"I am so mad that Tesla decided to remove the USS before they had HW4 ready to ship with the cars. I might now have a useless car forever, cause I have no idea how they will actually solve the parking sensor issue with just cameras here in Norway. The rear camera is always blocked due to snow during winter for example.."
Any ideas on cars just delivered? Had a Model Y delivered this week and having previously had a Model 3 with USS and a better system for parking (audible noises and distance from objects) and wondered if there were any plans to bring some of this functionality back? Would my Model Y maybe have HW4?
"Do you think Tesla will make the cars stereo ( like a toy box thing ) make a noise, some sort of sci-fi sound when accelerating or maybe lots of different sounds"
Just like your desktop or PC laptop Android or iPhone theres always going to be a refresh. And that comes with an increased price. My opinion is If its not going to make a ridiculous amount of difference and you want new. I would wait for the newest refresh. If you just want a Tesla and have a fear of wasting your money. A third party Tesla would be a great decision especially if its still carries somewhat of a warranty. Of course you could pay for a warranty and extra warranty. But I believe if these cars are going to save labor and cost on fuel in general. Its a good doer. Im not 100% sure if this car or any EV car is the answer or evolution of the industry. Im not the expert but in my opinion right now I own a Tesla model 3 LR and its saving me money because of my 160 mi commute to and from my work. Im saving anywhere from 200 to $500 a month. And that includes using a supercharger. Home charging works and help save but in the winter time the price goes up like the summertime for fuel.
I just want to know if the model 3 performance will get a horsepower increase
Any news on Track mode for Non-performance models?
"Could always buy now and when the new refresh comes out for either 3 or Y, you can upgrade. Meaning trade in your old model 3 or Y and pay any extra for the refresh model if needed"
"Nice job on the video brotha. Any idea when they will update the tesla vision to provide parking assist? I just got out of a car that didnt have it and bought this new model Y with the intention of having that, only to find out on taking delivery that it doesnt have it. SUCH a fun moment."
"My model Y delivery date is in May, I wonder if these changes will be implemented by then."
"I played this at 0.75x.. and it was a lot more bearable to listen to you in the evenings after work. Had a hard time listening your videos before, now it’s great. Keep the up the great work."
I ordered a MYLR a month ago and it’s delivery date is May. I’m hoping that hardware 4 is added before my build date.
Any idea of price point for the updated Model 3 and tax credit status? Also might it have a smoother suspension?
"For me, a delivery of a new Model 3 in September would be too late. In Germany there is only a government bonus for EVs for the self-employed until October. There is currently a 10% discount on preconfigured vehicles due to the end of the quarter. - Buy or wait?"
it’s dumb to wait unless there’s been a announcement from tesla
"I own 2 Tesla’s, I am definitely waiting on project Highland for sure! ️ IMO, if you don’t own a Tesla now and want the tax credit go with a M3 or MY performance models, You can’t go wrong with these cars, especially everything you get for this price. I believe project Highland will have a wider front & rear (including HW4 etc.) just like they did with the Model S. It’s possibly they could also remove the stalks"
I think they are not covering new stuff in those photos... I believe they are testing Tesla Vision covering ultrasonic sensors
Thanks Fabrizio for the cost updates!! Im waiting for the invoice for the first two months and then Ill be able to make an estimate for the beginning of the year. A warm greeting
"Great Fabrizio, you are the king of graphs and calculations. Well see you tonight"
"I also keep an eye on the TTF, the gas. Today, however, he made a big leap, lets see if the pun copies him in a few days. Excellent video, we have consumption and a similar situation, which has gone from protected to free variable since January."
"Oooohhh finally someone who shows us the clear data for charging at home. Thank you very much, I hug you very much"
"Thanks Fabrizio, I always follow you thanks"
"With these numbers it still becomes convenient to charge at home, even without PV. My free-market, fixed-rate contract expires in Rome at the end of April. They told me that I will switch to a contract linked to the PUN. If it stays like this, all in all I shouldnt lose much compared to now but... anyway I cant charge at home because the owner (lets say short-sighted) of the residence where I live now doesnt want to authorize the installation of sockets or wallboxes in the garage . Another matter is the other contract in Abruzzo which has moved to 28 cents. + VAT, where I can charge instead. At the end of the story, or Ill start looking for a less expensive supplier, Ill have to continue using only the columns, hoping that the prices will drop there too (I see it lasts less than 0.31)"
"Hi Fabrizio, I ordered the y this morning, the delivery date of March 29 arrived a little while ago, I wont tell you what color I got. Thanks for all the advice and information you give us."
"Great Fabrizio, super interesting"
"Wowwww Fabrizio super technical ... and for those who say that the electric car is not worth it .. in the end you spend less and less .. lets hope it continues like this with energy costs ... and yet the columns should also go down .. so far it is only Tesla got off it seems to me ... thanks for sharing ... see you next time, actually see you tonight for the live broadcast ... greetings ... Max"
Will you be there at E day too? Thank you for your advice and video Fabrizio
"The provisional cut in system charges should also be considered, lets see if they reconfirm the cut even after April..."
"Did you also calculate the ratio between consumption in the F1, F2 and F3 time slots to obtain the average cost per kWh? Not to mind your business, but I would assume you travel in F1 period, and charge the car in F3 periods or from the battery in F2 periods."
"You consume 147 wh/km, some need 800 kWh for those km. Which manager did you find? And what power do you have at home 6kw? Thanks for this info, great Fabri. See you tonight"
what is your new operator that I dont understand? nice analysis though!
"Be aware that if some journalist steals your excel table, it turns out that you spend €127 a month to travel just 100km and then you have to stay by candlelight at home otherwise youll lose the electricity and you also had to buy Power Wall, panels otherwise youd blow up the current also to the neighbors. When I charge mine, which has only 10kwh of storage, I make the streetlights on the block flicker"
If there is another summer test should be close to the usage in Thailand The battery should have been much warmer. Charge faster and run farther
"If in Norway the price is the same Shows that in Thailand, Toyota is not expensive because its cheaper than 500,000."
Good
thank you for knowledge
"Toyota, you let me down"
"Thanks Myong, I love your enthusiasm in these video’s. You do a great job and I enjoy the content…keep growing the channel. Aloha …Thomas"
Sending much love to you and your wife especially as she goes through the treatment
Great video - bring on the great EV rollout
"We all pray the treatment is going well for Shannon,another insightful video fella"
Always great videos... praying for your Shannon and family mate!
"Shanna, just wanted to let you know that you are in our thoughts and we are all sending positive vibes your way - just look at all the thumbs ups!"
cant see this happening in Australia any time soon as long as companies and distributers can keep ripping us off.
"Mate, I wish your wife and your family all the very best of luck and hope that your wife can recover from this horrible disease soon."
Prayers to your wife my friend. Best of luck to you and your family!
"Hi Sam, do you think this applies to Australia as well? I really want to get an MG4 when they arrive but I have a bad feeling they are going to be charging more like 50k rather than 40k when they come."
"I don’t think the wholesale price of battery inputs will necessarily stay down because the Ukraine war has put pressure on many of them. But I’m definitely holding out for the prices of EV to come down and I agree that the adoption of EVs is likely to be a lot quicker than the legacy media are saying. I would add that other than the batteries which are expensive and have their own carbon footprint problems(which I think will be aggressively addressed, while ICE tech is already optimised) EV are inherently cheaper to manufacture because they drastically simpler. They have one moving part in the engine,and don’t even need a transmission. That’s why the Chinese manufacturers are selling very small EVs for well under $10K US."
"I look forward to this great EV takeover!!! I really don’t want to purchase any EVs from a Legacy Automaker! I wish to buy from a “Startup” like Fisker, Tesla or Lucid! Prayers for your Family bro."
Cant wait to get a great EV the same price as ICE car here in Aus. The thought of charging it in thr comfort of own home and anywhere with a power plug is quite liberating.
My heart is with you and your family and the very best wishes to your wife.
Love it Sam! Best to your family
"Thank you for all your research and the information you pass on, its very helpful in this quickly changing world, I subbed a while ago. I hope your wifes treatment is successful"
Sounds like this is what everyone was hoping for.
"Wonder if Aptera can get their hands on some of CATL or BYDs sodium batteries to do a battery pack refresh. The idea of a 400 mile vehicle with no lithium, better temperature tolerance and better safety for way less is kinda awesome (math for volume and weight checks out)."
"Loved this video. You said the EV revolution is here with such conviction, and I believe you. It is Friday, 10th March 2023 and we gonna reflect how quickly the EV revolution took place, and I wonder where will the Tesla share be I five years."
Theres going to be a glut of cars in general at the end of this year because of increased production and lack of sales thanks to a global recession and high interest rates.
Im still waiting on a small pickup. Maverick was tempting but I would like a plug in and longer battery range.
The amount of work and time you put into your videos is not an easy task. Thank you for your videos!!
"Great Video Dave, the warming on the FLP maybe different in heating / cooling due to the packaging, I believe the Tesla uses Prismatic LFP packs which is physically different than the cylindrical 2170 batteries with the ribbon cooling / heating channels."
"Great video Dave, Ive been loving the series on charging in upstate NY at the opened up chargers. I havent made it to one yet, but happened to be at the Malta station days before they opened it up. I have a 2022 Model Y LR but not the CCS adapter and have been wanting to test it out. If youll be around the area (Brewster or Red Hook) over the next few days and want to test out charging on a non-LFP pack Model Y, let me know and Ill see if I can meet you."
Hey Dave. What do you think would be the time difference road tripping a Model 3 LFP vs Model 3 Long Range?
"You’re not going to see a speed difference. The other difference between CCS and Tesla besides connector, is software. They speak a different language in layman’s terms. That’s why older Tesla cars required a hardware change which added an ECU to translate between the two (like the one I added to mine). While your physical connector may have changed over to a CCS, I doubt that the software protocol changed from the default Tesla language. Nice to see that the adapter(s) doesn’t slow down the charge rate. This might be useful for those that tow. Been waiting for supercharger extensions to become available again, may switch to a CCS1 since it will be more flexible."
"Nice video, Dave. Heres an idea for your next video: since you live so close to New York, which has a total of 8 Tesla supercharger locations with magic docks, why dont you, or your wife, or both of you, take a trip throughout upstate NY testing each of those locations using your wifes GV60. On you way out you can charge on only superchargers with magic docks, and on your way back, use only CCS to compare which takes you the least amount of time. You would get a ton of views. Maybe your highest viewed video ever as you will be the first one doing this."
Dave do you get an option when ordering a Model 3 on the LFP or a standard battery? Seems kinda important with the charging speed differences youve shown from 250kwh to 170kwh. Im in a 2015 P85D so I max out at 128kwh and thats only at that rate for a few seconds.
When will you test FSD Beta V11? Hoping it will perform better than your last beta run…
"I was interested in your observation that your new battery type requires good heating before charging efficiently. Since most people are going to be using a Supercharger on road trips they should always use Tesla navigation to get there. Navigation preconditions the battery, but just driving to the Supercharger without navigation will not necessarily bring the battery to optimal conditions. Am I correct on that?"
Now that is what it is like to have Disposable Income..love the videos..gonna make the N.Y. to Cape Coral trip soon using your recommendations for supercharger spots...2022 Model S. Keep uo the great work!
5% to 25% in 5 minutes. Pretty good considering it has a lower max charge power than other Teslas!
"The Magic Dock CCS adapter seems to be rated at 350kw and I think that Tesla is considering that to be a hard limit, unlike their in-house cable/connector specs that they violate - Tesla did their cables and software right - they monitor the temperature and just let it rip at ""any"" current so long as temperatures are within safety margins."
Has anyone tried the Polestar 2 on the Magic Dock?
"I wonder if, even though you’re using the adapters, the charger still knows that it’s plugged into a Tesla."
"The main reason (without getting super technical) as to why Tesla V3 charge slower on 800V EVs is due to Teslas current superchargers being 400V architeture, whereas EAs and some other high speed chargers are 800V architecture, meaning they dont need to supply super high amperage to supercharge your EV. They do it with high voltage instead and low amps, meaning you get 1/4 less losses and 1/4 less heat (P=I²R -- high heat degrades the batteries faster, hence Tesla limiting it to a very short time), and therefore 800V architecture EVs are not designed to accept very high amperage as they dont need to. Now, Teslas next generation V4 superchargers will be 800V architecture, which are currently being installed in Europe first. Cant wait till they get here."
Awesome Dave! You may be the first to record north of 155 kW using the magic docks! And you were the first to use the magic dock on the GV60! Appreciate you! Start a patreon!
"At 15:18, you mention interest in comparing with a Long Range. Dave, I might be able to help you with some testing, as I live in Connecticut (we met at the IONIQ 5 filming in Tolland, and at the Pipistrel electric plane event in Waterbury), and I have a 2018 Model 3 Long Range, and an OBD dongle to be sure my battery is preconditioned properly prior to charging. Twitter DM or email me if youd like to try to meet up in Brewster, which is only an hour away from me. Note, I dont have the CCS retrofit for my older 2018 to be able to use the CCS adapter yet, it seems like that might not matter at Magic Dock, not entire sure, so it could still be interesting to see if that would even work. I also know F-150 and Rivian R1T drivers who might be interested in meeting with you, should that be of interest for future video ideas too."
"Dave, since you’ve been to the site a few times to the employees at the local Dunkin’ Donuts know you by first name"
"Great videos Dave, enjoy a coffee on me"
"Great video Dave. My new Y has the 2170 batteries, not LFP and not 4680’s as I thought as my Tesla delivery person told me. So I will expect higher KWh charging and not take it to 100% state of charge unless I am on a trip."
"If I use this for navigation over Teslas map, wont I lose the benefit of real time tracking/estimation on range left?"
Thanks for sharing! Do you know if the Tesla wireless charger can maintain a full charge on there phone with Hotspot and Bluetooth supporting this device? Btw.. will you get demonetized by Google for the music youre playing? Hope not!
"Can you help clarify something? The link you posted to the product says it requires a SIM card, but your unit does not. Can you help clarify? Thanks again for posting this!"
"can you show what happens to all the tesla build in apps when you are connected to this devices wifi, i would think they loose their internet connection, unless... the car is connected to the wifi of the Carlink and the Carlink is connected to the hotspot of the iphone."
"Does it let you listen to AND respond to text messages, WhatsApp messages, and Messenger messages?"
It was very funny how you commanded my Alexa device to play music when you spoke to your device.
Do you have to reconnect hotspot everytime get back in?
"You should actually look into the original item, that is a chinese knockoff of the Tesla Android project lacking a lot of security and enhancements and implements lots of shortcuts the original developer never approved. Its slow, requires a SIM card (the Tesla Android project does not) and has mani disadvantages."
I think you loose Tesla voice command feature if your not on Tesla network
Cool.
Please find out how to set up 360 camera in Tesla
"As a rough comparison, I agree. I have been running my M3LR for just over a year and using the cheap tariff from Octopus, my costs have fallen considerably. I have even been charging from solar the last few days. Not much, but enough to cover local journeys. Try doing that with an ICE car."
"Now find a good deal like this for the Model Y . Still struggling with the numbers to make one viable for me, but the recent price cut is bringing it slightly nearer to a possibility."
A BIG thanks to Masterworks for sponsoring this video! Invest in blue-chip art today and skip the wait-list by using my special link - 
"The 21"" wheels are heavier, but the range difference is caused almost entirely by the performance tires. Also the Performance Y has larger rear tires so you cant rotate them."
I’m looking at a new Model Y and keep going back and forth on the LR or Performance. I currently drive a 21 M3 with performance boost and it’s pretty quick. Thanks for the push I’m leaning toward the performance but will defiantly wait for the refresh + hardware 4.
"I purchased a 2020 model 3LR back in October from Tesla’s used inventory. Looked for one with low mileage and trims I wanted. Paid 49k and couldn’t be happier. Tesla threw in acceleration boost, FSD beta and upgraded charge pad for phone. Got the red with 19” wheels."
"I have the same configuration purchased on 1/13/23 (except no red paint). I did get the discount, FED tax credit + CVRP. I too did wish I had opted for the Performance version, but at that time I needed to be under the 55K cap (of course, they moved the cap to 80K the day after I had taken delivery). All that being said, Im still very happy with how it turned out (btw, I have a 2021 M3SR+ too). * One thing to remember is with the 21"" wheels this is a staggered setup. Therefore, tire rotation is affected."
"Lol- thanks for validating my decision to get a MYP When the prices dropped, I’m pretty sure it was the cheapest it had ever been. So I’ve been patting myself on the back for the good timing. Hopefully I won’t be regretting that decision when March 1st rolls around!"
I ordered a MYLR with 19in knowing it was back ordered a couple months may-June to lock in the price. When the official announcement is announced I plan on changing my order to MYP so that I get HW 4.
"Robert, listening to you, I changed and switched to the performance. I don’t want to regret anything. Thank you, bro. Hopefully it will not takes longer for delivery"
Big wheels = worse ride more expensive tires more often. Performance suspension & breaks way overkill for 95% of drivers. I purchased Long range with performance $2K upgrade with my choice custom black 19” wheels. Sold stock wheels to pay for new wheels. No loss of range or ride still plenty of speed. 2 years 57K miles Blue white interior ️
"I live in snow country on a steep road. I also use my car to go skiing every week. The 21"" wheels and performance tires wouldnt make it up my street in a snow storm. I am aware you can buy winter wheels and tires, but its a major hassle to swap them out and store which ever set you arent using. Also, you lose a little clearance with the Performance model."
Waiting for HW4 to get MYLR. Bigger tires are thinner and blow out more often.
Great info. QQ: where can we find the footage at 9:22 ? Are they available for usage for other tesla videos ? Please let me know.
"Just picked up my 2023 MYLR. Gave a lot of thought about waiting on new model or going with performance. I ordered mine on Jan 20th and got the lowest price and upgraded to 20"" rims. The tax refund pushed me into buying now. Cant throw away $7500 to wait for better cameras. Just not worth it. Didnt go with performance because of offset tires. Cant rotate them properly and Ive read that they dont last long and are pricey. Plus ride quality suffers. Going to buy acceleration boost soon. Super happy with my car. I cant wait to drive it every day!"
Happy with the interior choice? Any regrets not going white?
"My regret with my December 2023 Model Y LR is that I dont have any parking aids (no ultrasonic sensors) and I think Tesla is never going to deliver a vision based replacement on Hardware 3. I should have cancelled the order. I dont care about uber turbine wheels or going even faster in a car that is already crazy fast. But every time I drive it, I care about the lack of help parking I was so used to with my Ford Fusion Energi and my Volt."
"Wish I could of got lr model 3 or model y, but couldn’t do the payment for configuration I wanted. Black exterior white interior. Overall though I love the model 3 rwd puts a smile on my face every time driving it. Hoping tesla vision gets fixed 2023 no sensors . It’s like buying a cell phone. You buy now and next model comes out with different features."
"Robert, if youre really wanting the 21"" Uberturbines, I have a brand new set of wheels/tires I took off my 22 MYP last June with about 200 miles on them. Perfect condition. Nows your chance:)"
The 2023 long range has better Suspention that the performance
i regret that also for my model 3 long range..i wished i got a performance...everytime i see one on the road i think to myself that could be me!
I have a Gray M3P on order and hoping for a VIN # in the next week or two so I can insure the $7500 Tax incentive. I bought the Tesla All Weather Floor Liners and got them today. I also ordered the TEMAI Glass Roof Sunshades and got them today. I also got my Tesla Wall Charger and getting it installed. That’s a good start.
"If only one of the rear doors works, you should be satisfied. Should have run the sausage test on the door."
Dont the wipers come on automatically if visibility is completely obstructed? Like at 4:10 in the video?
Fun test. Missing electric S-max.. . Car built by engineers for engineers - 140 hp enough for me (and sick children)
"I could think of a motor and battery pack (donor car), the rest is just tossed in the pile ;)"
Why doesnt it have track-mode faith? Is there something that will be updated eventually? A plaid should have it as a minimum
"In summary: - sun protection, agree - undercarriage, partially - door problems, gross user error"
Sounds like a Trabant.
It helps if the tester knows what he does and what the product being tested is called. Its easier to get the door open if you dont choose to stand in its way.
Model X has played its part. There are now no good or rational arguments for buying this car. The competitors have left.
Funny to watch a reporter who has completely misunderstood the concept of the Model X...
"Listening to you and your dad just chatting is so relaxing and wholesome, hahaha."
I couldnt stop watching. I love these father and son drives. The conversation made it so much more enjoyable.
"Car is so much more confident. The gate thing is an absolute edge case. I think this software has come a long way! I think you guys are right about a basic language model. That could also be applied to things like the truck speed limit. Overall, very impressed. Your dad is really into it like you. Thanks."
"Really enjoyed “meeting” your dad. Thank you for sharing your day with him, with us. Can’t wait until my update shows up"
Just the consistent confidence on left turns vs where it was 6 months ago is noticeable. Looking forward to see the rate of change with v11
Great hearing you and dad. Should get my model y performance fsd in 12 days. You were a huge inspiration in purchasing a Tesla with FSD. Thanks.
"40:15 The correct action in this scenario is a huge debate even amongst humans. If the right lane is merging ahead, do you merge as soon as possible and line-up, or do you zipper merge at the end and use all available road space. While the former seems polite and less stressful, it actually causes more congestion. FSD has it correct here, although it could merge more gracefully at the end."
Thanks for the ride and chat. The play by play really helps explain some commonly odd fsd behavior
"With FSD, your car now does have an Ego! Really love the father son talk in this video, so pleasant to listen to."
"27:53 I mean, you guys passed a lot of cars being in that right lane coming up to that light."
YES!!! HE’S BACK!!!
"Im not concerned about the gate at all. Gates like that have no set standard (e.g. road markings or signs) for such gates, so theres very little that Tesla is going to be able to do to address this kind of situation. I cant see Tesla being able to handle that for a very very long time."
He is back! Love it. The car does have an ego. It is a Tesla! Lol.
Great video; be nice to your dad he is still learning..
On the part with the cyclist…maybe the car braked the way it did cause with the rear cameras it’s able to detect if a car was behind you or not. Your dad mentioned “what if a car was behind you when it stopped like that” well perhaps it already knew there wasn’t so rather then slowing down it slowed down fast just in case. You’d have to see how it does with another cyclist but with cars behind you for sure and see the difference
I really enjoyed this video! $TSLA always getting better!
It’s pretty amazing. Who ever thought a car could do this?
Lol too funny you guys ended up a block away from my uncle’s house.
You father is not driving at all. It is great how he keeps forgetting the yoke. FSD getting really close.
Tesla has solved autonomy. Now its just a matter of execution to continuously update the software to make it better . The autonomous vehicle is coming out by 2024 from Mexico. Going to be exciting.
Thanks 4 making the promises true cant wait to hold it
"yessss , congratulation cant wait to see it"
i have been waiting. I want one.
God bless Mr Elon Musk ️
I would like to test if possible
AMEN.FINE WORK ACCOMPLISHED.
Elon Musk is a amazing person. He always give the world the best products to use. I believe the Tesla phone will gain market share and can compete with Apple iPhone.
I must have one.
God bless you more than more and blessed you and your sweet family Amen Hallelujah
Nice

"Officially announced the sales of this new phone when they keep saying they’re announcing the sales, but I don’t see it in this video. It’s still remains a mystery. When can I get one?"
"If it does not have a good app store, it will go the way of windows phone."
Still waiting.
Thanks for PI phone
Can not Hardly Wait...
Does the smartphone Come with AI for my speech
"Good thing I need one, thanks Elon for that. Good thing I need one Thank you Elon for that."

Thanks you my dear darling you are very smart some things come true for you . But you dont know yet you will see .because you good person always alright
If this claim were even close to being accurate hundreds of other sites who are much closer to Elon Musk would have reported it. This is clickbait at its worst.
Why stock is falling Who selling?
"<I have about 5% of my portfolio in uranium stock, any advice on any other stock that I can grow my $300k capital to a million dollars?"
Block this site...another false claim!!!
Would love to see this phone break apple and Samsung and their ridiculously priced phones.
... pi is pronounced pie
The same CLICK-BAIT about a phone that doesn’t exist yet. We look forward to your next 10 minute video tomorrow saying the same thing again and again and again.

Svitlana Boczkowska UKRAINE THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING GREAT.
Tesla is introducing new electric vehicles to the market day by day. A formal review of the latest Tesla Model 2. It has very good acceleration. It was much more than I expected. This is actually the new generation car. Thank you very much for sharing this information with us.

This video is a game-changer! Teslas Model 2 is going to revolutionize the auto industry by making electric cars more affordable and accessible to the masses
I really like to watch those Tesla models and this is the another episode on it.
The Model 2 has been kept protected more than any other forthcoming Tesla. Clearly this vehicle is planned to be the companys volume sales leader with competition everywhere.
Amazing helpful video for me this is really awesome I learned a lot of things about tesla this video thank you keep upload like this and this video
good video. more information include the video about the tesla model 2. good explanation. thank you.
I would buy it if it isnt a small crossover.
I watch your videos with great interest. corvette eray in This video affects the whole world. It is a video stuck in life everyone should take seriously. There is a lot of good information. Thank you for creating videos for us. Please create more videos. Your channel is doing a great service. Thank you
tesla is doing smart planning for their future car models
I will believe it when I see it!
"Now, it is good reason to wait because of missing radar and parking sensors in Tesla Y and 3 :-) Vision is not bad but is not also the best for poor weather or visibility during night.."
Still cant afford it. Looks like Ill be driving in style in my old clunker for a while.
All ice vehicle owners will benefit greatly if they can drive their cars to the rubbish tip while the engine still runs
"ok, we got it, we are waiting :)"
"A.I. generated content, by any chance?"
Well I may never buy a Tesla with what I’ve been seeing they are poorly built and they aren’t a luxury car and have very few features on them. If the car has a warranty fine if something happens but if no warranty then you will pay a arm and leg for the repairs and if you have a accident with it. It going to cost a lot of money to fix it and probably the car will be totaled out. If so your insurance could go up a well not for me to buy for sure…
I prefer Hyundai
Lithium based batteries are not ecological because they need mining and millions of gallons of water to transform the lithium. Lithium based batteries are not the solution for the billions EVS. Quality built is another topic why Teslas are overrated for their costs. Teslas have been built for 20 years but still need quality control (which they don’t offer). Another topic is charging which the car makers need to standardize. Also you need to spend a lot of money to install a home charger (slow charging). Finally has anybody studied the impact in case of accident (EVS are twice the weight of ice cars)? Will someone survive if hit by an EV at 30mph? Are there any studies out there?
"Great stuff, its also important to note that Nio had 150km range left vs the Tesla which had 20km left on arrival, which is a huge difference."
"Great test, the first of this kind in Europe which is very appreciated! Kudos to you guys! I do think that NIO has a bigger advantage than the SuC as the NIO arrived with more battery left. Also, I think that the longer route it would be with battery swap station alongside that route, the difference would become much bigger - also, in time the battery swap should take less than 5 minutes after all the swap stations are calibrated enough and the user is used to the process of the battery swapping - I also think that thanks to the battery swap the driver may actually drive faster as long as it is allowed by the law! :) To sum up, great stuff! Thank you guys for this test."
"Nio is from China, where it got a much suffcient grid of swapping stations to ease the anixety of left. As the video shows, Swapping has an edge over Supercharging in terms of speed. ( more like traditional oil station filling up your tank ). The only disadvantage of swapping is that it is incompatible with other EVs. I mean, it is a suffcient system only for NIO customers. ? in the meantime, Tesla starts to allow other EVs to use their supercharging stations as we speak. So, in the long run, I believe Supercharging will triumph Swapping.But, hey, SWAPPING IS REALLY COOL AND FAST, isnt it ?"
"Just realized while watching your video, the supercharging takes different amount of time depending on SoC at the beginning of the charging while the swap takes the same amount time for getting SoC from any value to 100% (1%-100% or 50%-100%), THAT IS AAAAMAZING! Ofc, it provides a second possibility to get more SoC than most of the EV brands out there offering only 1 possibility. I always prefer more options!"
"Hey man, i discovered your channel not too long ago and i have to say this is QUALITY content :) Keep it up!"
"These are really early days for battery swapping so I can see the swap speed increasing significantly as well as the user experience. No doubt there will be many improvements in the future as this user experience is at the core of NIOs business model. Nomi, NIO houses etc etc. I also cant see any issues with queuing as that would imply every car will arrive at the station within 10 minutes of each other (or whatever the swap time is). Thats just not going to happen, besides, as the network grows youll be rerouted to another station. They may change the design and use some sort of carousel system...who knows what will come. Itll be interesting to see how this unfolds though. Also dont forget that Shell are onboard with this plus full automation will be just round the corner"
You can also fastcharge a Nio. So there is the flexibility of options.
"Nice comparison, obviously had the Tesla charged to 90% it would have been more time. As mentioned towards the end unfortunately the NIO and swap stations are not available in the US but maybe this will catch on."
It is actually a comparison between: you can only supercharge it VS you can both supercharge it and swap it! More options means more flexibility and less anxiety.
I’d love to see a similar drive test with the BYD Seal when you can get a hold of one.
"Very interesting. Something not being considered here is driver and passenger comfort, ie going to get a coffee or food, stretch ones legs or use the rest room. On long journey humans like to do these things. So with battery swap looks like you have to stay in the car, therefore these other activities have to be added on…"
"You didn’t talk about the advantage of getting a refreshed battery as well with the swapping. Also if better technology comes out, you will get a newer battery with longer range and up to date. Try that with super charging!!"
"And if you would have travelled 50 km extra, the Nio would be able to do it immediately, whereas the Tesla would require another 12min charging. Also, charging faster would require another type of battery (more than 800V?), whereas swaping under 5min would just require the generation 3 swap station that is almost available."
I am really surprised by how it took almost 8 minutes to swap your battery. Ive seen videos of it in China being done in less than 5 mins for the whole process. Perhaps they are still calibrating.
Do you have the information of how much you guys spent for this trip and their efficiency (distance/kwatt)? I think this would be an even better comparison.
"Great video. Very interesting. Im curious that, whats the cost difference between battery swapping and rapid charging? Also, are NIO battery swaps common enough to make a long trip convenient? Or are you forced to deviate from your route or forced to take a route that has a swapping stations. I would assume Tesla charging spots are everywhere but I have trouble believing that NIO has that many swapping stations."
"My concern is that Nios business model is shaky. Neo needs to build swapping stations equipped with spare batteries along all major corridors, which is more expensive than building charging stations. That cost cannot be shared by other manufacturers, and it has to be recouped, which puts Neo at a disadvantage compared to all conventional EVs. Without the financial support of the CCP, Im not sure theyll be able to build enough stations to make this truly viable. The stock price has tanked. I know, because I bought shares a few years ago."
Battery swap is cool but think about if you have 10 or more cars waiting to swap a battery. The swap station is much larger than having multiple supercharges can you put 30 swapping stations side by side Just a thought.
"interesting test, but must be very special and optimized route to work for the car with battery swap. In this case maybe 1 out of 2 possible routes in sweden where it works. I have been in China for 2 weeks driving Nio et7, where they have more than 1200 swap stations (sweden 2) but there is still much easier to quickcharge becouse there is to far between swap stations. Sometimes you must swap battery after 150 km to have range to next station or you must drive to other side of a 3 million people big city, can easy be 30-60 minutes to get to the only swap station."
Of course the biggest advantage of battery swapping is that you avoid battery degradation over time. Having to replace your battery after it is out of warranty is a huge expense.
Hi Sandy. I have watched your show a number of times and I have wounded why a lot of car manufacturers make electric cars with a reduction drive gearbox when you can get an axle flux motor in the wheel hub like the aptera has. No gear box would be more efficient. So why don’t Tesla make their cars with a motor in each wheel hub? Regards Tony Appleby
I love these videos!
"Great engineering = single point of failure...! Therefore, extremely reliable part!"
The power glide/350/400/700r/4l60/4l80 gm transmission fit every model for nearly 60 years
"Well... I guess the time has arrived to swap engines in my 1990 Honda Civic, with the PLaid engines. I say.. 2 engines, for the front wheels, and the other for the rear. I reckon I can 0 to 60 in about 1 hospital run."
GOOD JOB E L O N VERY PROUD OF YOU
"I dont know what to think. All these smart analysts telling us about the revolutionary technical aspects of Tesla, on top of many people telling us Tesla stock $4000 to $10,000 in five years. Yet the stock is $174 today. What am I missing?"
This guy must have a lot riding on Tesla stock.
"Sandy seems to forget you can ruin a perfectly fine car by saving a few $ to much as Tesla has done by removing the radar and utterly screwing up the drivingexperience in anything but lab-perfect weather. ""You just need to catch up so the car can follow the car in front of you""...Was Teslas reply when i complained about my car doing 4! MPh in approx ½ mile visibility (FSD here we go LOL)...Thats how bad ""Vision"" is...But all Sandy see is reduction of production price, not realizing the fight against the wipers that are forced auto, but with a just as bad automation so you have to change them while auto-dim fires main beam at the car that overtook you and are now 300 Yards in front of you, recognizing the reflexes, dims, waits up to 8-9 secs and then fires those main beam again.....Btw..Up to 8-9 secs is the time auto-dim is to fire up main again after passing that car on the deserted road...Safety first? No, utter greed."
2:43. Thats called software Sandy. Its software. Not magic.
"Tesla has a lot of amazing engineering, but people care about cheaper cars. We know that there is not enough lithium in this world to create as many EV cars for the whole world. dishing hydrogen is not wise, we need research in hydrogen to make it a potent fuel for car industry."
"Its no longer a story that the world is experiencing a global economic downturn, Im so happy that Ive been receiving $64,000 from my $15,000 investment every 8 days"
"Elon Musk is an alien. People thought he was being cute sending his car into outer space. Actually, it was a birthday gift for his son on his home planet."
".Ive been quite unsure about investing in this current market and at the same time I feel its the best time to get started on the market. i was at a seminar and the host spoke about making over $972,000 within 3 Months with a capital of $200,000"
"Wow,Wow,Wow,"
Tesla stock is tanking.
"wat no 2 for 1 bitcoin,, im astounded."
DONT TAKE THE BAIT
No one on the planet??!?! Does he know that Porsche makes more per car than Tesla?
"almost 60k subs on content theft. #ContentTheftWorks! Even more hilarious though, is you watermark the center of the video with your own logo on another mans content and dont even TRY to hid the theft by only zooming in half the distance needed to hide Sandys own identification graphic"
"Thank you! See, Ryan Shaw and Robert Rosenfeld, it’s possible to make interesting videos without clickbait and repeating things everyone already knows over and over again."
Thanks for the video and again with lots of helpful information.
Looking Forward to A Faraday Future SUV EV Video.. Now # 4 in EV Sector in Avg Daily Trading Volume ahead of Nio. The FF 91 Futurist and FF 91 Futurist Alliance. Just 26 days til start of Production. Thanks in Advance.
Getting my Model Y next week. The salesman told me it should still have USS. Let’s see!
Wrong. Updating the cameras does not make it hardware 4.0. Those will only come on model s/x first.
It just looks the same with a bigger exterior
you need to tell people its only SOME countries that DONT HAVE IT!! Australia and many other countries that have the steering wheel on the left side still have ultrosonic sensors on the 2023 models and they will remain.
6:23 woooooooo getting some screen time
Great show. Im starting to look for an electric car and need all the info I can get. Thanks for your video.
Wait I thought they put all model y’s in the 80k category now?
When does CarPlay go live?? I get my Tesla on Monday and I’m so excited to hear this! I’m assuming this will be for all Teslas?
And yet his Teslas self driving is already light years ahead of anybody else in the industry according to the other engineers out there
"That’s great but first Tesla does not offer free camera upgrades, also Tesla should removed the USS before having a complete software that relies on cameras only. Left too many upset customers with that stupid decision."
"The wisest thought that is in everyones minds today is to invest in different income flows that do not depend on the government, especially with the current economic crisis around the world. This is still a good time to invest in gold, silver and digital currencies (BTC, ETH.... stock,silver and gold)"
Is that real news? Apple car play is here? How can I install it in model Y ?
I enjoy my supercharger. It’s attached to a 1998cc petrol engine and Mercedes called it ‘Kompressor’. Some people bought two or three toxic Teslas since that car was made.
When will absence of uss be updated
$6000 6000$
"The video is incorrect. HW4 will be present in X and S. Replacing the cameras alone is not HW4 ... Pretty unfavorable title of the video, hope the buyers find out somewhere else."
So prices are returning to pre-covid levels. Big deal. And thats with a car that cant park.
"Great updates and I appreciate the zippy-ness, no need to spend one whole video on each item! Id also recommend the newer version of the Carlinkit that allows Android and CarPlay access (the newest one without the sim card). I also installed the swivel screen mount kit - I love it even though it lowers the screen height just a touch. Keep up the great content and still looking for R2 to make it back to a vid!"
"Thanks for the great information and content! Very useful as always! Quick question, how do the Teskings wheel cover compare to other types of wheel covers for the Model 3 such as the Hansshow wheel covers or the Rimetrix wheel covers?"
I am a family man but also love taking our pets on trips too. The only thing you missed was a possible sun shade for the roof and pet covers for the back seats.
I love my Tesmanian second row seat back covers. They help protect the back of your rear seats if you’re putting large items in the trunk
Those wheel covers look great! Definitely thinking of picking those up.
"The seat protectors under the car seats, inside & outside ceramic coat….are all awesome, highly recommend!"
"Have you ever noticed a difference in the matte screen protectors reflections between MY and M3 screen? The Carwiner Matte one i put on M3LR was amazing. I could not make out any shapes in the super hazy reflections (in a good way). The carwiner one i put on MYLR appears only slightly hazy2, and I can make out the shape of B-PLR/Seats/Passenger, etc in the reflection which is more distracting. Reached out to seller on Amazon and they said its the same product. Could it be the amount of light coming in MY compared to M3?"
Anyone have experience with the Weather Strips? Im considering for my MYP just curious if it actually helps with some road noise or not.
Good stuff! I am loading up for my new 2023 MY Performance coming in the next week or so. Thanks for the code on the phone mount! Saved me $30. Giving it back to you.
What do you guys think of the steering wheel detachment that happened a couple of days back? I would like to know your thoughts on this. I have a tentative delivery around this month end. I would like to make an educated decision before I decide to take delivery or otherwise.
I have that under the armrest storage too and always forget I have it
I just ordered roof sunshades from Tesla after roasting all of last summer in my Y and 3.
Love these!
Great selection !!!! any storage options for the frunk to organise ..
"The trunk organizer bins say it fits model y 2020-2021. Just want to make sure both bins fit as some reviews are saying they dont fit, please confirm."
"I was just driving behind you man, I was the wrapped Tesla with green triangles"
Thank you Good Sir!
2700$ for full ppf. Thats insane
Can you tell me which sunglasses you wear? What model is it?
Thanks!
The baby is absorbing the flow of information like a boss Id give her a year and shell be helping you with testing EVs
"I look forward to the retest. After watching the 1000km challenge on the live channel, it felt like a big let down to have a fairly expensive, brand new, EV take so long. Good news that Toyota is paying attention to your channel."
Interesting that they emailed you immediately considering that you were the only honest youtuber who brought some true facts about deffects. Hopefully they want your feedback to improve the car even more.
"Good to see a manufacturer take the constructive criticism in stride and look to improving the product in a timely manner. The 1000km challenge was poor and deserved the criticism, looking forward to see the improvements in May. As usual born has already said he will redo the challenge."
I love it how big car companies get scared by little Bjorn. Just amazing. Keep up the good work. Love you for it!!
"Toyota Finland informed that the car is indeed limiting the DC charged kWh per day. At the moment it is ~90 kWh and with May update ~170 kWh. For some reason they are presenting this value as ""DC charging times per day"". One charging time equals SOC from 10% to 80%."
"Interesting to see how the industry takes Björn more and more seriously and sometimes reacts very quickly to his criticism. But also a bit embarrassing for Toyota: the vehicles are tested for months by several engineers and trained personnel, Björn only needs a few days to point out all the errors and opportunities for improvement"
I found bjorn to be very generous regarding the car and it’s flaws. 10% buffer change + summer weather in may ( semi cheating in a way..) will make it look better than what it really is
Nice to see that your reviews are making a big impact on all Toyota BEV customers
"So based on this video, Im assuming Bjorn rips the BZ4X to shreds and now he is worried he went too far"
Once again Toyota is frightened to lose its market share but still they don’t want to admit they’re 15 years behind Tesla and Lucid. I feel pity for them
"Interesting to see you got a fast response Bjørn Calling them out on their failures will hopefully force their hand at fixing the car. Love your ""keeping it real video with cute baby"""
Incredible what the tests you run do.
"""At least it has stalks"" I can imagine faces of toyota representatives watching it, just after the bZ3 entered production... without indicator stalks"
"Are you not a bit worries about all theses changes ? I mean some small changes seems possible with updates but doubling the number of fast charging allowed, removing most of the buffers, etc. I cant stop to wonder why they were there in the first place ? Where they needed ? Where they overcautious ? Will the new change make the batterie degrade too fast ? Whats the drawback ? If they are noone why didnt they do it like that in the first place ? For me it feels like Marketing telling Engineer they need theses changes."
"Im really curious to see which improvements Toyotas engineers will be able to achieve with the announced software update: Charging speed, battery thermal management, energy consumption, battery SoC percentage and km range display during charging, ..."
What a cute baby. Isabel is a real cutie. Keep on doing these videos Bjorn. Toyota should be signing a few checks for your work. The work they neglected to do rather than depend on engineering nerds. These EV makers can only get better when they are pushed. Well done.
Not certain if a software update will fix the energy usage. It will be incredible if is able to match the competition with just software.
Well.... Excited to see this Car kick Ass with the updates.... 20-80 in 60 minutes. Impressive. In 2018.
"I hope this will apply to North American/CATL batteries. Next stop, a preconditioning button!"
At the same low price or above?
"Dear Moshe, I understood that the sensors were removed and there are only the cameras also in the S model, please inquire"
Gotta love humanity . Ur vids are the best most honest least biased fsd reviews. I usually get the update a week after you! Thanks for doing these! I appreciate u. Tesla should really pay attention to ur reviews.
"After watching all these FSD videos, and now that I have FSD and don’t have a lot of time before I get it. I have learned that YOU are the most reliable/watchable person that does this thanks for taking the time for it."
Great drive! Was expecting better for this massive transition and city/highway merge. Love your commentary and agree 99%. Thanks!
"Also try the new voice feedback on interruptions. It might be useful for auto-labelling, allowing FSD to improve faster."
Watched 3 V11 vids today and this is by far the most informative!!
Great feedback as usual but I feel the car can handle a lot of situations you take over for. I understand this is because you’ve experienced damaging a rim before and that’s a costly fix. Looking forward to getting the update to put it through my own paces. Thanks for your dedication to the cause.
"The blue stuff gets priority for evulation, blue means its an object of interest. Two wheelers coming from behind a bit too fast will also be blue."
"Thank you, sir. Very thorough and thoughtful as usual. Not to focus on the negative but every time there is a new step release, I’m hoping for greater progress. Compared to where it started the progress in what it can do is remarkable but even one single thing it can’t do keeps it from being truly autonomous."
Your videos are solid man. Thanks for doing them for us who have FSD but are not as trusting as you are. Lol
"Wow, impressive performance on 11.3.1. Waiting to get it on my 2022 MSLR, hopefully soon."
Thanks for reviewing so fast. Patiently waiting for mine
"Looks like some fantastic improvements. im still debating whether or not to pay the 1 time fee for the FSD on my cybertruck reservation, vs just paying monthly when i might use it."
there sure are alot of Tesla vehicles in this video!! great content!! upvoted!!!
"Great video, thanks for sharing. I thought Chicago drivers were bad but your area beats them. Keep posting."
"Also gotta remember that this being a bit underwhelming is expected. Every time Tesla does a major update to the stacks, it always is kinda wonky at the start, almost seeming to regress slightly, then they update it again and that’s where the changes become more apparent. :)"
Great production value!
"Lane change on old Highway NOA without confirmation was always available, it was just disabled by default. It tends to jump between lanes though in an illogically dumb way. I hope it gets better with v11!"
That is the first time Ive seen it use the blinker when merging onto the freeway.
As usual the most unbiaised review! Thanks!
"Great video, thanks! Could you elaborate a bit more about the 32:18 - why wrong lane? The car is about to turn right, so being in the rightmost lane seems like the most correct thing to do. Actually where I live it would not be legal to turn right from a left lane."
"With the wheel on the steering wheel, you can set the quality to the desired level on Youtube. Otherwise good video as usual from you Chris"
"Another good quality video, yes, as always. The S Plaid is already the burner, amazing, except for the steering wheel, I dont like it that much either. The interior/cockpit definitely looks better than the other models. The implementation in the information system such as Netflix, Youtube would also make sense for other vehicles. But what I also find extremely cool is the Tesla 24/7 Lounge :-) Your REAL idea is something good again, you can see you simply live the topic and are really thinking about moving/changing something."
"Great video. We dont always agree on taste, but I have to agree with you about the Model S. Its also the most beautiful Tesla for me, just a bit big and a bit expensive. Unlike you, I find that the vertical display of older Model Ss fitted more harmoniously into the car than the horizontal one today. Overall, I find such a display to operate the car suboptimal. In order to operate the car, I have to take my eyes off the road. On the one hand, Im not even allowed to pick up the cell phone, on the other hand, I sometimes have to tap different parts of the screen several times for central functions in Teslas. I can operate physical switches blindly."
"Great video again! I think the thing with the REAL is great, I sent you a long message, that WLTP just does not help to be able to estimate the e-consumption as a combustion engine driver, but I didnt expect you to deliver something like that right away."
"Brilliant with the REAL value! Great idea first. But you could also do it like with Spritmonitor, which states the charged kWh + mileage after loading, then everyone has their own statistics and Evium could use the data as a REAL average."
"Very cool and entertaining video, Chris (and Fran) I agree with you, in this price range (perhaps in all?) the biggest difference is a matter of taste! I think its good that everyone will soon be picked up electronically with their ideas. Thats how it is suppost to be! A matter of honor, my i4M50 will soon be in your new REAL list - great idea!!"
"Cool Chris, we were just in this Tesla Lounge last week! Great video!"
"Great video again! I have a comment on the SuC vs. Ionity cost comparison: It should be taken into account that charging is usually not 100% on the go. For example, I charge about 50% at home on the wall box - I assume your calculation is based on 100% charging with Ionity or on the SuC."
"In reality, however, the price difference between SC and Ionity is significantly smaller. With Ionity you pay ~10% charging losses every time. With the superchargers, you only pay for the KWH that actually end up in the car, because the things are not dish (lol), so the Tesla itself counts them as charged."
Great video. On the subject of Ionity vs. SC: Did you also take into account in the calculation that Tesla only charges the net kWh received? Thats a good 12-15% difference to other HPCs
"Great video, very neutral and pros/cons named by name without glossing over anything or artificially speaking badly - compliments! The comparison with Taycan also helps...had the pleasure of test driving both (MSP/Taycan) and can agree with you on all points. To be fair: the price argument remains. Everyone has to decide for themselves whether to buy a 2-year-old Taycan Turbo S or a new MSP for the same money."
You can also order the steering wheel without a yoke. I would be interested to know how much is already possible with voice control. Cool video. I especially like how even hardened pros like Car Maniac are so happy when accelerating! Thats fun!
"Cool idea with the consumption calculator. Unfortunately I havent used it in the summer yet. My 500e used 21 kWh in the coldest phase on the way to work, currently at 6-10 degrees on the same route 13 kWh. The difference is really big."
"Great video! Informative, amusing, once again Chris! Thanks for the video."
Cool 2 weeks ago I had my car for a week because of a parking bump in Kirchseeon I can only recommend Auto Christian in Oberpframmern
"I got infected by your enthusiasm for the Ionity chargers and subscribed. Unfortunately, so far all (a total of 8 different Ionity loaders in DE) have not worked. Each time I phoned the service for ages and tried it, once it blocked 1 euro on my credit card 25 times. The statement from the service was, I have to push the plug over and hold it during the charging process because its so heavy... thats awesome when its raining outside or its below zero... what kind of statement is that please? Every time it started charging and I opened the drivers door, the charging process stopped. What is this garbage. There shit... Im happy with the superchargers and probably save many hours of life time on the 300 euro difference over 10k km."
"I think if I drove a Tesla, I would still use the supercharger, especially with this lounge and the toilets. This car is a weapon and I would always hand wash it. But Ive been doing that with my cars for years, even company cars just get cleaner. Door sills and the interior always have to be sour for me. Im picky about that and just take my time."
"Supercharger is simply very practical for ""travelling"" because nobody can say that it isnt like that. It is also an advantage that abroad (I am from AT, for example) in DE and CH you do not have to worry about charging cards and which of mine works on my way and what it costs. You can argue if its cheap, but since when is comfort cheap, you have to say it."
A REAListic video - Thank you!
May the juice be with you as you go to insane speed with the bowl ^^
"I did this about 2 months ago, wish I had this video when I did it. It took about an hour, but def had to double and triple check everything to make sure I was doing it correctly. Very glad I did it, it improved the imaging and treble of the sound system by a ton. Well worth the $60 and time it took! Great vid."
Great video! Have you noticed any difference in max volume? Or does the amp automatically take into account the extra power draw from the 4 speakers. Thanks again!
Pretty cool.. bizarre how Tesla wouldnt just activate the speakers though
Best video I have seen so far. Really need to see the new harness install. Thanks sooo much.
"Thanks very helpful info, i will order mine now. Thanks"
Hey. I am thinking about doing the razor sx500 1800w build that you did but want to see a top speed and acceleration test with a gps phone app. if you could make an updated video it would be greatly appreciated.
Did you order the DIY (new version)? I saw another video where he installed a connector on the driver and passenger side. Does the new version only require access to the passenger side?
"Going to assume this is the same process for the Right hand side 2022 Model 3, with everything still being in the same spots? Great vid, thanks :)"
Can you do the footlights also?
any idea why those speakers are even there if theyre not activated from the factory? Are they reserved for a higher trim package or something?
in
Does it improve the sound at all?
"Crazy they include the speakers but not the harness, like why not save $ and weight by not including the speakers and extra wiring??? Also no software changes needed....interesting."
Why would anyone want to void there warranty just to install speakers?
Can you make a ranking of cars between the quality it gives and its price?
"The model and performance, has 534 hp, in fact currently 06.2022 it has 562 hp, with a range of 514 km (WLTP) and weighs 1995 kg. The technical data of the video is from the first performance in the United States that came out."
Congratulations for the work you do!
"Wonderful. It has it all, although the price is not yet within the reach of all mortals."
"Tesla is above superchargers, but it is true that they still have to improve reliability, anyway if I had that money and going so well I would surely take it, excellent proof Mr. Dalmau."
That car is spectacular!!
"These speed bumps are regulated. If the city council does not regulate them, there is a state regulation that regulates them. Greetings and thanks for the video."
"It is still a very handsome car, and the wheels of the most beautiful of an electric, the Yankee And if it is well done, it is because in Europe we know how to build cars, even if they are American."
"Hello, first of all congratulations for the very complete test Second, I have read all the comments and you are amazed at how uninformed people are. I love cars and I have tried a Tesla model Y ""performance"" like this and FLIPASSS how it goes is just amazing..."
Thanks Joan for the video and information.
"Interesting product, can the third row seats be installed? Good video John."
"How thin Dalmau looks, excellent video, a well-deserved like"
Better sensations than a Taycan. You can value from one to 10 to each one. I dont know which one to buy.
Tesla is still tolerable why despite that bad deterioration of the interior we still brag about how beautiful they are
"Hello, your videos are spectacular as always, but just like they look well done, city, curves.... But..... Always during the day, I dont remember night driving tests for, for example, how the Tesla headlights look ... Because those of us who drive more often at night would like to know if this Tesla is safe at night due to its Led headlight system. Thank you."
"Dalmau, you have fallen in love again!!! From a Scalextric car!"
"It will be what it will be, but I havent seen Dalmau genuinely smiling at the cars reactions in a while."
We hope to see your test of the EV6 GT soon !! Greetings and excellent work!
"Yet another electric that is basically a silent computer on wheels. I understand that the acceleration and silence is attractive, but those of us who miss boards full of little buttons dont quite like it. Equally greetings :)"
"Not that Im a Tesla fan…. I like them a lot but I think that now Tesla will have to pay attention to after-sales, I think that with the factory in Berlin their quality claims will improve but now the second part is missing services"
The most sincere car channel that exists
That you speak with all the objectivity in the world and having self-criticism and arguments and even evidence and PLUS 25 minutes without ads and commenting on it as you always do... I think without a doubt that it is the best channel for reviews of cars/motorbikes/experiences around the planet. 10/10
The best and most candid video of a Tesla Ive seen so far. (My hype has gone suddenly)
"Fix: Autopilot comes free on every Tesla. What costs €7,500 is the Full Slef Drive (Total Autonomous Driving, where you can really drive alone). However, Full Self Drive is not allowed in Spain (besides, it is restricted)."
"Kudos to the owner for his honesty and sincerity, owning a car or whatever shouldnt blind us, thats constructive criticism."
"Im cool that the review is like staying with your colleague who understands cars, very easygoing without failing to explain everything in great detail and the occasional dash of humor! How big HAHAHA"
"Next video ""How to build a tesla with aliexpress parts for less than 1000 euros"""
"I was surprised to learn that this car can be configured in 1000 ways, as if it were literally from a video game, on YouTube there are thousands of reviews of this car and no one explains it that way, or at least not on Spanish channels. As always good video. We hope to see a camperized one soon"
“I dont care if they have a screen” The menu that puts a screen on all your cars...
"We all know that he slowed down because it exceeded 120km, nothing happens vicesat your subscribers we love you"
"The ""Autopilot"" is applied when you give it the order to get to some place, thats why it didnt take the exit because it wasnt indicated on the route"
It would be nice if it had a solar panel where the sun heats the most so it charges the battery
In 1 video about the Tesla vehicle you said much more relevant data than Saúl López in 20 videos. impeccable work
"Congratulations on the 2 million subs, I always enjoy your videos. Keep it up ;)"
"The update thing happens with old cars too, thats because sometimes its cheaper in production to put the extra on all cars and deactivate them by software. and when you pay the extra activate it. Ten years ago when I was studying automotive they showed us a video in class that talked about this. And as in some workshops in Germany, for doing the oil change, etc... they activated some as a gift."
I loved the explosions! But in reality it is assumed (these are the typical things that nobody confirms or denies) that they are direct current (400V) contactors or relays opening or closing that make those noises
"I had seen more videos about this car and they all said only the good stuff, thats why I like your videos because you say things as they are and after seeing your video even though its good quality and price, I wouldnt even think of wanting one of those. great video"
"The fact that you have to have your hands on the wheel with the auto pilot is due to the regulations since in a possible accident or that the car does not detect something that you can take control of the vehicle And the sound of the compressor, if I remember correctly, was intentionally increased as a requirement of the governments because by not sounding they were afraid that people would cross the street thinking that there was no vehicle."
Meanwhile in the mind of vicesat?...
Great review and thanks to the owner for bringing this to us.
Great video on the latest Y.
Great review! Beautiful car
"The Matrix LED headlights are in the Performance model only, correct? Or are they now standard in the LRs too? thanks!"
"I was wondering how come the blue paint is soo good. Then I saw the ccs port, that’s when I realized it must be made in Germany"
"Top Notch Video, Keep It up, I love the Video. The New Model Y is really Gorgeous"
Excellent video bro this video is so nice detail and all
How long does it take to Auto lock the door when you get out of the car?
I thought the quicksilver colour was only available in Europe. How did you get one in America??
"So when does this version come out with quick silver coming out? Also, this has the upgraded cameras does it have hardware 4? Where was this located that you were able to see this?"
"It does NOT have updated 5.1 mp cameras. Those are not yet on the marked for Tesla, but will be later with HW4.0"
"felt like watching tesla tutorials again, do you work for tesla or something"
You inaccurately quoted a max range of 330 miles. This is the performance Y which has a 303 mile range.
Thank you very informative video
Speaking speech pacing is great.thank you.
Nice
"Tesla changed the way of driving, which is risky actually on road if you get used to traditional driving"
"This is the model y performance model. The brakes are ceramic? I didnt know that. I just received mine and just never know when the car is completely off. Sometimes in the morning, it appears the heater is on and car is already warm. I think its been going all night because the battery has gone down 4%."
I prefer the plastic over the soft carpet. The plastic was higher quality imo
Seems like the perfect car for a homeless person!
Good salute
"I agree with most of the things you mention, but I differ on one point and that is the trunk, even if it is worth US$1,000,000, I would not include a feature that, however remote the possibility, could cause the trunk to seize. open when youre running, that would bring with it other security implementations that would have to be applied to the cart... however, I congratulate you because you always bring too good content"
"The screen behind the wheel, I dont know if it has changed now in the new ones, but in the previous ones the screen was customizable, if the map does not appear, the consumption appears, the tire pressure or even the cover of what you are going Listening, it seems strange to me that they have removed the option..."
"I completely agree with you about what you are saying about Steve Jobs, his philosophy and in the end that of Apple, I had already noticed the model and certain finishes could be improved. Regarding the air conditioning, it is not always deactivated by the companion, if they do not accompany you. How well you say, there are things that can be improved or they will have some reason. Are we talking about the main lights of the model 3 or Y?"
"Personally, I think that for the price and features that the S plaid model has, it should come as a base with carbon-ceramic brakes..."
"Hi, Eduardo, first of all congratulations for the videos about Tesla that you make on Youtube, I love them and I hope to buy me a model Y soon. I am writing to comment on an article I saw in an OCU digital magazine in which Tesla was listed as one of the vehicles that break down the most, I dont know the reliability of this statistic but I am also concerned about the reliability that my future car may have. Greetings Eduardo, keep it up."
"They are details as you say, but when you realize that you paid 140 thousand for that product, in the end you wonder about that price because they didnt include it...! They are questions that will never get answers excellent video as always ️"
"I think its a good video, for what the Model S Plaid costs, youve gotten a lot of things out of it. Always a pleasure to see and hear your comments."
"They are perhaps ""minor"" details but that end up affecting the user experience, comfort and practicality of the vehicle, you will say ""ahhh its not a big deal, theres nothing wrong with it, Ill let it go"" but then you remember that it cost you 140 thousand, thats when you say, nonono, a car of this range and this range should not lack this..."
"It seems to me that in some points you exaggerate, although I understand that the price of the car deserves to have all the changes and conditions that you propose. The haptic buttons seem very interesting to me, you propose that the buttons to raise/lower windows have it, and I think that in this case, some traditional ones are already fine, because somehow we need to interpret the action of raising with a movement and the to go down with another (although with a haptic feedback we would achieve the same). Then, the trunk buttons and such I also understand that you comment, but maybe some regulation prevents them from being haptic (or maybe Tesla decides not to put so many haptic motors, I dont know). What does seem bad to me is the finish of the sheet when you have raised the trunk, but what I do not tolerate (in any of the Tesla, even if it is the cheapest of all) is that the fraletero is manual, it is something that I very hard to understand. Its just that it wouldnt mean any price increase almost... Besides, in the manual for each car, Tesla tells you where to place your hands to close it in the best way and avoid problems. With a motorized one, it would not happen, and apart from people who do not know how to place their hands, they would not ""damage"" the car."
Don Eduardo I dont know but I think that as a client I imagine that you can send suggestions…. And they will surely make updates and I tell you to enjoy that super pot you make me healthy envy
"The issue that the side mirrors still have a pass or accept an octopus as a pet, but the rear mirror at that price level should undoubtedly be with a camera. On the other hand, those trunk finishes are unforgivable. The hood should also be automatic like the rear. The air conditioning still has a pass because few (or none) thermal cars have the cancellation of the climate on the passenger side if there is nobody. In addition, the entire cabin is heated or cooled."
"For example, I like the map, that if it is deactivated it appears in black. Some things are a matter of taste..."
"I dont have any information, thats why Im asking here, how many out of every 1000 cars do the window buttons get damaged during their useful life for it to be a problem in the model s plaid?"
"Some of the things mentioned can be corrected with software updates, even for cars that have already been sold (instrumentation issues, passenger air conditioning, the blind spot camera, etc.) although others cannot (haptic buttons, digital mirrors and details in the welds )"
"I think that on the subject of the buttons you are exaggerating and with the third of the screen, the heating and the rearview mirror I am in total agreement."
I understand that the front trunk is a security measure: what would happen if it was automatic and the button was pressed to start?
"Good video as always Eduardo, just one question, what is the line that you see on the steering wheel that passes right between the L and the A of TESLA? Thank you very much and what a car"
It is for safety that the front trunk is manual... imagine that someone activates it by mistake
Always correct in your analysis Eduardo
"Well, I totally agree with you."

"This video is a JEWEL, one of the best in editorial aspect, in context and clarity in the information that you disclose, dear Eduardo. I have the privilege of following you for many years now in TW and now with your Tesla project and the way in which you speak not only about the company, but also about the way in which we are witnessing, thanks to your approach, is always very inspiring. , perspective and vision, of a revolution in the mobility industry, energy and future of this planet. Congratulations on this and ALL the content you make. Your passion shows in each of them and that also inspires. A big hug from Mexico, Eduardo!"
If they had given me €1 every time I heard/read something about the €25K Tesla this weekend I could go to dinner at a good restaurant with my wife on account of it.
"It must also be taken into account that Tesla can lower the price because its assembly lines are super limited, each vehicle has very few options (tires, colors, interiors...) that also helps."
"What worries me is what happens in the event of an accident, with those unique pieces that are so large, and with a not very strong rear blow, there are models that split the battery plug due to a bad position, refuse to repair it and the house it tells you to change the battery... cars that externally only have to change the rear cross member, the gate and the bumper..."
"I dont have a Tesla but, I fall in love with everything you share about Tesla technology. I can wait for the new model 2. While I will continue to be in love with Tesla technology. Thank you Arcos."
Excellent video Edward. We are very happy to have the new gigafactory in Mexico
"Excellent summary of what happened in Texas, thanks Eduardo... Until today I have convinced 12 people who have already bought Tesla, among my relatives and acquaintances, the issue is that no one regrets having acquired one. greetings"
"The reason why they paint the car with the doors on and then remove them is because the batches of paint, even if they are the same tone, are never exactly the same, but it is interesting what they say about doing everything at the same time separately"
"I like to watch your videos and sometimes I watch them twice, like this one for example. By the way, waiting for news about the lowering of Tesla vehicles, in Europe the model 3 and Y and in the United States the model S and X. That this week is putting pressure again with its lowering. In Spain the 3 is worth 44,000 euros and the Y 46,000 euros. If it falls below 40,000 euros in Spain, it will surely devastate the market like never before and it is close, very close to achieving it, not to say that the aid from the moves plan would work, it would be up to 37,000 euros for the model 3 and 39,000 for the model And, with the 7,000 euros with the maximum amount of aid and with 4,500 euros of aid with the minimum, the 3 would remain at 39,500 euros. But that waiting up to 2 years to collect it makes it impossible to ask for help. Thats why I hope Tesla continues to lower prices. A video of the moves plan would be nice, especially to compare with Europe and the world, talking about this drop and talking about the ""INFERNAL LABYRINTH"" of the MOVES plan."
"I was waiting for the car to show up. I dont know why, honestly, why it wasnt said that it would be announced but there was an aura that made it appear that way. Lets hope to see it soon because it looks quite interesting. About the G3, Teslas work is incredible in every way."
"I have it very easy and clear and I can tell you with a very popular article. The cell phone that we all have and know gives us the experience of what it is like to depend on a battery. Thanks to the battery, the cell phone does not need a design with planned obsolescence, the battery takes care of this. Thanks to her, no matter how good your cell phone is, you will be forced to change it and not only that, since you will not be able to resell it. There is no technology that maintains the health of batteries, but even less is there an interest on the part of companies to create it. When we have more electric cars, we must consider what to do with the batteries that must be disposed of and that are much more polluting than anything else."
"These new processes are very interesting. But it gives me the feeling that they make the previous models (3,Y,etc) obsolete. I wonder if in the already established factories they plan to renew their manufacturing processes so that these previous models have the advantages of cost reduction and efficiency than the new ones. Because in models like the plaid that I like and are expensive, there are things that are behind cheaper models like the model and, I dont see the point that being more expensive they are inferior in some technological aspects, what one would expect is that they be best at everything"
"Very good news Edward. Teslas policy is appropriate despite going against the grain in terms of stopping outsourcing and subcontracting components. His know how then covers 100% of the product. There is a methodology to achieve this but it is alien to the obsolescence and mental immobility of the leaders of the main manufacturers, who base their activity on outdated models and not adapted to the new system requirements."
"Does the total cost of ownership include the fact that you need a home with an individual vehicle charger? And on the other hand, doesnt the monocoque battery close the way to being able to change the vehicles battery if a more evolved one appears on the market, or to recharging technology by replacing batteries like NIOs?"
"Thank you for your explanatory video, everyone has said that Investors day has been crap, I am waiting for that presentation and for the price to be clarified to change my second car. All the best."
"After buying a standard Model Y and a little over a month later seeing that I could have bought the long range dual-motor for almost the same money, I have no doubt that it will."
"I live in Santa Catarina Nuevo León, México 🇲🇽 where the Gigafactory will be located and here is a “Boom” from this long-awaited automotive manufacturer!!!"
"Many, many thanks Eduardo for extracting the key elements from the investors day and for having being able to release your video the day after the event (actually with the time difference it was even the same day!) and without compromising on the quality of the video nor of the script. None of the French or even American channels I follow have been able to do so the way you did. Very impressive. Regarding the content of the news I totally share the excitement and look forward to that new stage for the car industry. I also note it seems Tesla learned from its past communication mistakes (the roadster II) by staying at the development level in that event and not showing images nor even giving the name of the car. Good. Thanks again Eduardo.Cheers, Fab. (apologies to all for writing in English, my written Spanish isnt good enough...)"
Mexican pride
"With that steering wheel, it would have to be tested on an evasive driving circuit. All the best."
"The great revolution will be reaching 1,000 real km of autonomy, lowering prices, not being so heavy vehicles, creating chargers for everyone, that fuel electricity comes from alternative energies and that batteries do not degrade in 8 years but rather in 20 or more. Great video. Thank you."
The best video Ive seen of this model to date. Greetings.
"Do Teslas have electronic steering or are they mechanical steering? And another question, do you have the directional rear axle? And the last one, do they have a rigid or independent axle? Greetings"
You have the option to choose carbon-ceramic brakes in the Tesla configurator when making the reservation
I cant believe getting that steering wheel approved... good video David.
"Brutal. I dont understand the 3 engines, 1 in front, another behind, and what does the third do? Thanks, David!"
"The most complete car in history, with permission from the Rivian R1T ️ lets leave behind the hatred and fear of progress without even testing it, petrolheads!"
"Ceramic brakes have been offered as an option since the beginning of the year, they will surely suit you."
"We have to adapt to changes, this vehicle is for a new generation, we like loud engines and big round steering wheels, this car is different, thats all. Kind regards."
"Without having tried it, I totally agree with you. This steering wheel makes driving difficult. It looks forced (it is normal that half of the steering wheel is missing) and if the flattened steering wheels are less ergonomic than the circular ones, this invention does not contribute anything to driving, in my opinion, if not quite the opposite."
Another excellent video. The car is insultingly obscenely priced. Who has 140 thousand euros? Sure many.... but the remaining 99% of the world does not. The day Tesla puts out a decent car for 20 thousand will be the real moment of electromobility.
"Ufff that way of choosing the direction of travel, I see it as super dangerous! Accidents will come!"
Excellent video!!
In life I will buy this car (unfortunately...)
Definitely that steering wheel is a mistake on the part of the manufacturer; I see it even questionable from the point of view of security. Excellent job as usual. Big greeting !!!
"Teslas build quality vs. Koreans like the KIA EV6 is too noticeable. Too bad, because they were the pioneers in a segment where little by little they begin to be left behind."
But if they put a TV on the dashboard
"Everyone here talking about qualities, assemblies and handling jokes when they havent been on one in their lives. Ah okay, theyve seen it on tik tok hahahahaha Im leaving with the staffs win"
Does this one also loose the steering wheel in the middle of the highway?
"Congratulations ! I own a Tesla and this is the most objective test Ive seen, by far, on the vehicle. How wonderful when a product is analyzed without prejudice and based on objective data."
"Meanwhile, ""Teslamaniac"" and the ""Taliban of combustion"" are always grateful for this type of evidence with an impartial point of view."
"This channel that we have in our country is to be admired. It reminds me of those top gear shows I used to watch in the 2000s. Congratulations, its for it to be a channel three times as big."
A round of applause for Diego today. Exposing those shots well with that fog and a black car is much more difficult than it seems.
"As always, I work impeccably, and I reaffirm that this is not only the best motoring channel in Spain, but also the best Spanish motoring program. Thank you guys for your impeccable work"
This is not a YouTube video. It is a documentary of the 2. What a level.
"Car without competition and unmatched in many aspects, very good video"
Youre the best. Technical analysis without prejudices. Its nice to hear you
"Congratulations for such an objective video and without going into the ""in-laws"" that are sometimes seen when talking about electric cars and/or Tesla. In the comments they have cast some of these offended specimens by the volts but in general it is seen that you have followers at your level. A good like to this video"
"My goodness Guille, it almost makes me want to buy a Tesla, what a wonderful video."
"Well done Guille!! You have gone to publish the video at the best possible moment, tremendous price drop yesterday. I hope you have a lot of visits, the quality of the content deserves it. What a punch from Tesla to the competition (other V.E.) when all manufacturers only raise and raise prices (including Tesla until yesterday) interesting times come."
"Good Diego. What would you recommend between the Mach E, KIA EV6 and the model Y with great autonomy today? With the drop in price of that particular model, its cheaper new than the models in the Wallapop search..."
"Every day I like your videos more, I love the technical approach that you give and that makes it easier to make purchasing decisions"
"Great video, very objective and with the usual quality of Powerart. Here in Canada you see more and more Tesla, and that the distances are great"
"Oysters!!! Guille, when I heard about the ""normal SUV front seat dimensions""... I think that now written it looks infinitely better than when the script is said ""all in a row""... At first I froze... Well, as always great video. Thanks for your excellent work."
"What videos do you make, really, you are one of the best on the market in engine videos, thanks"
The best review Ive seen and most complete. From today subscriber of the channel. Damn dude youre a crack
"Very good video, its nice to see a professional talk about a car."
Fantastic job Guille. I loved it even if it was 50 minutes long. Greetings
"No words, great analysis. I am one of those who would like a model Y, it would suit my needs 100%."
Great video Dan!
Loved the drone shot of all the cars practising summon. More tests like that would be cool!
what a great video! it was so cute and the ending is hysterical when the cars had to scramble. and the popups guessing the price of a new X too funny! still informative and loved seeing the entire family on a ride in the Model Y. Oh and the door opening was adorable!
Just imagine the model 3 Y and S having automatic closing doors
This is an absolutely beautiful vehicle. This entire family is so beautiful. I love the transparency of this channel and their videos. Thank you.
"Dan is such a good person, I hope more good things come his way"
There was a pain in my heart when I saw them complain about having to open the door.
Elon didn’t just spell sexy he spelt sexy cars S - Model S 3 - Model 3
"Wow, I love seeing all these cars all lined up together. Great Videos!"
"Great video, Dan! I purchased a Model 3 in Miami back in 2017, I have since moved (finished school, got work, normal facts of life for a 26 year old). My parents kept their condo there so I kept the Tesla and brought my gas powered (its a 2003 BMW X3 3.0 fully speced (wrecked car bought at auction for $15,000) to where I live now, in Austin, Texas...the clunky old girl is finally starting to die, with 175,000mi on it. I am a single guy, no kids, and my girlfriend goes to school about 200 miles away, so at most, 2 4 people in my car (family and friends)...my buddy bought a Y and is selling his 2015 100D X for $68,500 (my MAX budget)...do I go with the X or buy a new Y? Dependent upon any answers, why? I have yet to sit, see, or drive a Model Y."
"Hey, Dan, I would get a Model Y when I get my drivers licence cuz with the 3 and the S I struggle to get out so having the Y will make it easier for me :D but unfortunately, its not out in the UK yet but it will in late this year"
"It is my dream to own one of each Tesla, please do this again when the cyber truck and next gen roadster comes out , so good to watch."
This was by far the best car review that I have ever seen I was laughing it was so entertaining your family is awesome! Plus I got a better idea of Y I definitely want to get it!!!
"You know youre rich when 62k for a car is a ""good deal""."
That fast forward followed by that automatic stop behind a car gave me a mini heart attack lol 9:00
"Great video with great cars, slick narrative, and an awesome family. Thanks for sharing!"
i remember your channel from like 4 years ago
FYI: The middle seat the smaller one can be individually seperated to have 2 seats on the back
"Dont launch or accelerate hard when the X is in high suspension setting, this will cause a strong vibration in the wheels. This often happens in my S if ive been over a speed hump and havent reached 60km/h yet where it auto lowers. I think Tesla sent out an update recently that auto lowers based on distance rather than speed now. Tesla tech told me never to launch in high which makes sense as the geometry of the suspension would be off"
“Let’s all wear white and not tell the roadster”
"That happy face is truly priceless... You did it Eduardo!! Im very happy, I know what it means, beyond a car.. A dream come true."
"congratulations bro! You deserve it, that feeling of getting something youve been waiting for so long is something youll never forget. Congratulations"
"The reaction to the first Launch made my day HAHAHAHA if something makes someone as formal as you talk like that, they have to be strong hahaha. We are very happy for your achievement! ️"
"congratulations edward Thank you very much for sharing this moment of intimacy with us. A truly authentic person, I wish you the very best and a happy holiday season. I see that Santa Claus has passed"
No one will ever understand how a man can feel happiness for another man who barely watches his videos. And how happy I am to see how much you are enjoying it. how big are you crack
"I feel that this is better than a special of 1M subscribers and things like that, this is a tremendous achievement and I am super happy for you, here in Argentina I dont know if it will ever come and if it does it will be very expensive, but it makes me happy to see it for videos and if I get to see one in person Ill die, anyway, keep it up Eduardo!!!"
"Congratulations, Edward. You deserve everything good that happens to you, for all the good you do ️"
"Congratulations, Edward. Enjoy it a lot, as much as I enjoy my Model 3. On the other hand, let us never forget those who do not have our fortune. Many people are having a hard time for different reasons, lack of resources, illness, etc. Lets try to help those who need it as much as possible. Thank you and Happy Holidays."
"Congratulations Edward! One of the most anticipated videos of the year!!! We fell as a Christmas present for everyone!!! Enjoy, you deserve it, and keep sharing content with us! Greetings from Orlando, Florida"
"Congratulations Eduardo and thanks for infecting us with your emotion! That car is your new life, you embraced the Joy of Living! With respect to the car, respect it a lot, and in ""plaid"" mode please be very careful, because this ""machine"" is only dominated by a professional driver!"
"I think a lot of the excitement is the wait time. It really influences and I think the year and a half has been positive. You deserve it. And why not, I deserve it too. And, well, everyone who will see this video deserves it, dammit!!"
"In good time Eduardo Good luck and enjoy it a lot, you deserve it"
"Don Eduardo, impressive. You have made me smile throughout the video, until my cheeks ache from the happiness you convey. Enjoy, its finally here."
"Woooo were all waiting for this moment. Im so glad that you can give yourself that pleasure, that dream, that luxury. enjoy it the best you can And I will always be watching that quality content. keep it up youre a crack"
"Congratulations Eduardo, few things make you happier in life than receiving the car of your dreams, I hope you enjoy it a lot and share the wonders of this car with all of us."
"Enjoy it, Eduardo, when life gives you things like this, its because you deserve it; enjoy, thank GOD and life; God bless you; Greetings from Colombia."
"Congratulations Eduardo, enjoy it everyone and see telling us about your experiences, although it is a car that is far away for the moment, hehehe What a gift from Santa Claus"
Many congratulations Eduardo you deserve it enjoy it you waited a year and a half normally be nervous it is your first car of that very sporty style I am very happy that you finally arrived many hugs and greetings from Mexico
"Hello Eduardo, I really accompany you in your excitement and joy. I know how it feels because seeing how you expressed emotion made me remember the moment I was handed my MYLR22. With all my heart I congratulate you and I hope you enjoy it a lot and I hope you continue sharing your emotions and experiences with your model S plaid."
"Congratulations Edward! We were also looking forward to seeing these videos. Its amazing! Enjoy it, you deserve it."
You should twitter Elon Tusk. He is always responsive when it comes to these types of videos. Greetings!.
"I, who thought I could never buy a new car, have bought a Skoda Fabia 1.0 TSI and at 57 I am the happiest man in the world."
Someday first God Ill have a Tesla like this... I dont have how but I hope to go far and achieve great things.
When you realize that a van charges faster than your phone
Thank you for introducing us to this wonderful Tesla technology. You managed to convey your enthusiasm to me. Greetings from Argentina.
"Wey, you dont know how many times I came back to like the video, to realize that I had already done it; youre a badass, keep it up!"
- Me: How I wish I had money to buy a Tesla :( - Salo: Im going to buy 2 xDDDDDD
"Youre the net...... I wont get tired of saying it... Youre a badass, I loved this review. Super natural wey, your face in the acceleration has no mother... Hahaha Congratulations."
"Im sure that if you mentioned Elon he would reply either on Instagram or Twitter, for me without fear of saying it is the best video of a Tesla that I had ever seen crack Solomon"
WOW I fell in love at first sight ... this is a gem.
This man is the only one I dont get bored of seeing until his infotainment system.
"Tremendous level, congratulations, Im not a fan of any youtuber, but youre into what Im most passionate about, which are cars, and you make some super good videos, and you really know the subject and it looks like you like it."
"With all my heart congratulations for being that good vibe that motivates so many people, you are a badass brother"
They are all luxurious for me they are all true works of art in every way I hope they reach my country Ecuador and I can get one
I love that salomundo explains to us how to use the car as if we could all buy one xdd
"Ive always liked Model X, but now it fascinates me... The truth is, who knows if Ill arrive one day, but as they say, hope is the last thing you lose... Excellent video, I have never seen such a detailed video of this truck and I love it, from the bottom of my heart, thank you bro"
"I cant wait for the new Roadster to come out, buy it and show us epic videos with it You are a crack I love your videos"
"NOW I DO BELIEVE IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, I FELL IN LOVE WITH TESLA"
People in 1987: Cars in 2020 will fly Tesla cars in 2020: 20:58 Dont suck who farted?: v
"Damn great, I love the way you transmit and the boss you are on the subject ️"
"Hi, very nice feedback. I completely agree with you and just 15 days ago I received my Model Y. Afterwards I also really like the beautiful mechanics but with Tesla we are really on to something else and with the Mustang you youll never have the same uses (you probably already know that). For me its either Tesla or both! One is for fun, and the other is for everything else. So you will always miss one or the other but surely more than the other and it will be the right choice."
Very cool video man! Its up to you to make the choice of the Heart!️
"Very good reflection Roman! For my part, I am doing the opposite, with a Subaru that I have (still for the moment) and that I really liked (despite the costs, maintenance, etc. which cost a small ticket). And if I end up selling it (for reason), I will never regret it despite its cost. You have to know how to have fun, and satisfy your passion."
"Im going to do like many Model 3 owners, Im going to switch to the Model Y. My choice will be the Midnight Cherry Red color Perf, which is too beautiful. “Family” car with Lamborghini Urus perfs, too stylish!"
"To have seen the Bullit in real life, it is just superb! I think its the last moment to have fun with a thermal! I also thought of getting myself a Mustang for my 40th birthday, but I was wise. Instead I got myself a Ford Kuga in Vignale and PHEV versions. Unfortunately I only do 5000 to 6000 km per year and suddenly a Mustang was clearly not profitable.... Treat yourself with a Mustang: D"
"Hi, I also have a German Shepherd and took the model S. He is fine in the big trunk. For me, the 2 big flaws of the model 3 are that there is no tailgate and no display in front either (screen or on the windshield). Model Y, good choice even if I dont like the look but Ive never seen so much space in a car."
So good this kind of video feedback
"Ba to have a Model 3 clearly I also ask myself the question. However, I am waiting for the update for tesla vision or the return of the radars because clearly I cannot see myself doing without seeing the templates of the Model 3 or Y even worse"
"Personally, I think a car you can work on and repair yourself is best. It is always a pleasure to learn mechanics. A BMW 5 series can be really good."
I will vote to keep the TM3 perf but good
"For me now, it would be hybrid for autonomy and to save a little on the full... an electric one is great, but you have to put an indecent budget to have a little autonomy... and then the tech options and the comfort. Look level: jaguar without any hesitation… I find the e-pace just magnificent. For the moment I have to be content with a 207 whose clutch has just let go...."
Top video we want more like this :D
"if you want a good investment for not too much its clear that a jaguar f-type is perfect, theres a lot but really a lot of chance that the next f-type will be in v6 so the old one cant what to take in value! But its true that level up is not really that"
"From my point of view, the model s great autonomy corresponds perfectly to your expectations (without yoke)"
"Hello, Thank you for this feedback and this dilemma you are facing... It would be up to me, I would tell you to stay with Tesla, or at least on a V.E. because going back may make you regret the low cost of traffic, the incredible silence and comfort of an E.V., the instantaneous max torque, the super nice community (a bit like among bikers, which I am too). .. and, geek that we are, the V.E. and especially Tesla vehicles, theres no better! ^^ So in conclusion, the most important thing is that you have fun, and I think a TMY will give you the best of both worlds. ;-)"
"Without hesitation Model Y performance. Im 33, Ive had it for 9 months. Its ultra practical, ultra comfortable, ultra connected, ultra fast (perf of a URUS), ultra spacious and ultra economical (no maintenance). For nothing else I will not change. Ah yes… A model X, if I can afford one day…"
"Y perf without a doubt!, on the other hand if you want a 2nd car, take a small punchy one like an RS3, an A45S, if you go looking for V8s you will die a tax, it would cost you the price of a 3 perf d okay :)"
"Hi Roman, I am also getting out of a 2022 TM3 propulsion to come back to a small Twingo RS, a pleasure car at not too expensive. The yoyo value of Tesla does not inspire confidence at all on the long-term value of the product, which is the reason why I decided to sell it."
"I have my model there for a few days after a model 3. It is exceptional, for nothing in the world I will come back to thermal."
Me too I want a model Y Im waiting a bit to see the finances ^^
VAMONOOOOOO!!! happy day bitches!
"Salo: ""Tesla is very late, they told me a date and they deliver the car super late"" Also Salo in the last video: “I cant wait to show you the car tomorrow!” Video: *posts it 6 days later*"
"People: I dont like this car, I miss the engine noise Salomundo: When you drive a Tesla you wont even miss your aunt"
Is anyone else happy for the happiness of others or is it just me?
"Have you already tried the cheeta mode? I think thats when it really accelerates from 0-100km/h in 2 seconds but needs a preparation time to regulate the temperature of the battery, engines, suspension, etc."
"I love the way you enjoy the car and your simplicity to share what it is to have one of these cars, I dont know when I got to Mexico, but one of my goals is to buy one."
Ecologists: Synthetic leather. Salomundo: Vegan skin: V
"I have a Model 3 Performance from over a year ago, and I can say that on a day-to-day basis, it is the most fun, exciting and easy to drive and use. I always say it: its like those who bought the first iPhone and all the geeks saying that Blackberry with a thousand buttons was better. That the ""all screen"" thing was a passing fad. Well look now."
"I missed your car videos, you dont know how excited it is to see you happy with your Tesla."
"Very excited, I show my daughter the video of the new car and you wont believe what she told me without getting so excited...""THIS CAR WOULD BE A FAVORITE FOR THE SQUIRRELS SO THEY WOULD HAVE MANY COMPARTMENTS WHERE TO HIDE THEIR ACORNS"""
The intro is one of the best that Sergio has thrown
Impressive work by those people. Thanks for the video.
Im happy for you salo!! I hope one day to be able to have this type of car... go for my dreams!! Thanks for giving us this kind of content. Greetings from Argentina!
I dont know if Im the only one but I love how the clouds look through the sunroof
"Cars matter almost nothing to me, but seeing this genius just makes my day and since he started presenting cars to the common people his program is infinitely more interesting. Anyway, were looking at a communications genius. A big hug."
I cant wait for Juca to try that speed to see his reaction hahahaha
"Impressive, I would have liked to see the acceleration from an outside shot"
There is no better publicity for Tesla than the good shots that Sergio and Uncle Salo blow up Like if you think the same
"They went to another level with editing, musicalization, everything! I dont know if youre working with the same post team, but I thought the quality of this video is above the rest. My congratulations for that. great content"
What Grefg says: There is no time limit for likes. What we understand: You have 2 days to reach a million
next video of grefg: first day living under a bridge with 2 teslas.
"but if there are already a million likes, for when the car. I think Grefg loosened a screw 2021: Grefg, buy a car 2025: Grefg, buys NASA"
Its been 1 year bro we are all waiting for the model s yaaa
How humble the nexxuz lending the tesla to grefg
"Said and done, 1,000,000 likes. You are the big one."
Epic HAHAHA asking for a tesla from a tesla
"The Tesla model X was lent to you by Nexxuz, right, because the license plate is the same as that of Nexxuz, so that those who said that there was bad vibes between them can see that it has already been seen that they are not and that they are great friends. Great the 2!!"
The Grefg in 2021: 1 M likes and I buy a Tesla The Grefg in 2026: 2 M likes and we bought the white house
I already reached 1 million so I wait for it with humility
"Grefg: If this video reaches 1M likes, Ill buy the TESLA RODSTER Grefg 1 year later: PEOPLE BUY ME LATAM"
Grefgs next video: Im in the hospital removing my kidney
Grefg coming soon: Goodbye confidence with the bank: v
"The girls: Things like cars dont matter, Im going to eat lettuce. Grefg: In a moment of desperation David Cánovas, 24, decided to sell his kidney"
"THE PROPHECY HAS ALREADY BEEN FULFILLED TODAY 07-19-2022 IT HAS 1.3 MILLION LIKES, HERE WE ARE WAITING FOR THE TESLA ROADSTER. GREETINGS FROM CRACK RUSSIA"
We should try to reach about 5 million likes so the grefg tattoo doesnt feel bad
Next video of Grefg: selling all my belongings to buy another tesla
It does not happen to them that this effect requires gpu acceleration
I came to leave my like to reach a million and I see that we are already going for 1.2 million o_O
Thegrefg is incredible he can even monetize buying his luxuries this man is incredible never for xD
You should do a range test with vs without wheel caps
Great result. LR on 19 summer tyres when it warms up a bit more will surely be amazing. 21s really seem to make a huge difference winter or summer versions. Im curious to try a MSLR and see how much it loses to MSP on performance and gains on real world range on die Autobahn. I had originally planned to order LR but then all that carbon and the promise of a warp drive seduced me!
It is amazing how much the difference in speed affects efficiency even with these really aerodynamic vehicles. Slowing down just a little bit really does improve efficiency by a lot.
"Really excited to see Lucid test results. I wish Tesla would include larger batteries, or produce the Plaid+ they once had planned."
"incredible that the car gets only 33% more consumption at 33% higher speed, Id expect it to increase consumption by more than that"
"For this size and power, NIO ET7 might be a good comparison. Since they have the exact same drag coefficient (0.208?), it would be interesting to see the drivetrain efficiency"
There is no speed discrepancy on OEM tires. Great results for comparison. The only problem is to hold your horses
Can’t wait for the Model X LR range test!
simply the best electric car. Better than the plaid for real life!
"The yoke will always be ""the joke"" for Bjorn"
"I did expect the better consumption than the sister Plad, thanks for your precious video"
The plaid in your Video have 499kw batteriepower at 17% SOC. Does the Long Range have the same Power at this SOC or does Tesla limited it more ? Thank you
"LR and Plaid same range. 8% difference i test due to caps, wet road and slightly colder."
An iconic car!
Wow I wait for the summe rtest. It will beat them all! And also be the first car to be far below 9h on your 1000km challenge
Do you think that the narrower tires these two cars are wearing have a significant impact on consumption?
I have expected so much more! Long live EQS 450+
Project Pall - A - Dium (as in the precious metal) if people want to look up the meaning
"Björn, Is the vehicle height the same for Plaid and Palladium?"
will you retest in the summer?
A couple of comments on what you say here: Neither Angel nor I have received compensation for this video. We havent agreed on anything before recording. Ángel sees the car right there (he had seen it go into the workshop but nothing else).
"Very good, Lars, very good. Transparency, humility and self-criticism. Thats the way and not just fanboy videos. Congratulations on the video to both of you and thanks also to Angel for lending himself."
"Honesty is shown by looking for the positive and the negative. Congratulations Lars, this video was necessary and shows that you care about the truth, not bigotry. Chapeau!"
"Im an automotive perceived quality engineer, Ive been here for 15 minutes at the moment and the truth is that this is a masterclass on what quality means in a vehicle, it could have saved me 4 years of study and 6 years of experience hahaha"
"I live in Miami and I just bought the model Y, all the defects that you discover in your video, my vehicle has. They adjusted the hood and did not paint it, the loose plastic fender liners, the left rear headlight has water inside, they did not completely remove the roof. Im going to make a video on those issues and Ill put a link to your video for people to see. I congratulate you, it is a very good job, I hope you continue working like this."
"I really did not expect this... Lars, of course you are a crack devising content, at your feet."
"This video helps the consumer not only in peace of mind when buying one, but also with a bit of luck the Galician who works in Berlin will see the video and make a report to Tesla with what needs to be improved. Very good work!!"
You make a great couple: one analyzes from a user perspective and the other from a technical point of view. Please keep collaborating.
"Incredible, Ive lasted 55 minutes and I liked it a lot. Youre a phenomenon Lars, youve even made friends with Ángel. We could call him the Spanish Sandy Munro. If the improvements could now be transmitted to Tesla Berlin, and they were heeded, the better for everyone. If there is any manufacturer that is reinventing and improving the way of building cars, it is Tesla, although there are still aspects to be improved. Excellent job to both of you. Thank you."
"This video definitely needs to be seen by Elon Musk and his entire team of engineers and designers, all over the world and in all of their facilities, and that they hire people to replicate this, and at the slightest imperfection it goes back to the factory, is that This is worth gold, its a whole class on how to check the post-production vehicle, its customer service, its total supervision, the disassembly was missing to see what else can be improved, but in general you can see good progress, really It is not that we are demanding but for what the car is worth pffff it is even scary to drop that money and that everything will come to you badly if it would weigh a lot on me, regards!!!"
"Great Lars, you just taught Saul a big lesson (not wanting to make it clear). You have done what had to be done and, at least for my part, you have made me look at Tesla vehicles in a different way (as long as they are made in Germany of course)."
"Plated for Tesla, theres clear evidence as to the improvements, and plated for you two brave duo! WE WANT MORE VIDEOS TOGETHER!!!"
"As an engineer with more than 10 years of experience in a car factory and having been involved in several launches of new models, my sincere congratulations to Tesla for the great job they have done. Even being a press unit (it receives special treatment when it is manufactured) it is extremely difficult to achieve those levels of quality in such a new model and such a new factory. Thank you very much Lars for bringing us the video and congratulations on it."
"Ángel is very intelligent in his words, he takes very, very good care of himself, that is to be respected a lot"
You have made my day: say exactly what you see. This video had to be seen by Elon. Millions of thanks
"I loved the video. Good both. You have to be critical, and honest. It is the only way to improve and press."
Too bad we couldnt gut the car a bit more...Lars I challenge you to find a private individual with a Tesla from Berlin to see the welds. Congratulations on the video...a super positive surprise!!!
"Lars, what a great video! This is a contribution to the VE community. I hope they let you disassemble another one in the future. All the best!"
"What a magnificent video with two heavyweights, Lars and Ángel, from the automotive TUBE channels collaborating meticulously to check if the quality of the Model Y from the Berlin factory has improved. I liked it a lot."
"I dont usually comment on videos but this one deserves my respect and admiration. A luxury to see the two of you with that emotion of doing something that shows that you are passionate about it. I want more videos of the two, even a channel together with this content. Hint: Twitch/Youtube Live Breaking Cars"
"I am not Mexican but I am quite happy to know that this company will have a headquarters in Mexico, which will provide many jobs"
"Mexican pride, incredible that they speak better of us in another country than in our own"
"I am Salvadoran, but hearing that ""Viva Mexico Cabrones"" filled me with pride. Little by little Latin America is appearing more on the map and thats great!"
Long live Mexico bastards and all Latinos!!! I feel proud to know my country is starting to improve in some way and positively!🇲🇽
"Happy that your headquarters have arrived here in Monterrey, lets hope the city evolves a little more technologically"
"I am from Monterrey, Nuevo León and we are all very excited here :)"
"Proud to be from the north! Proud to be from Monterrey! Cheer up Latin America, a breakthrough and opportunity for everyone! Greetings Tecnonauta, the best technology channel!"
THEY ARE THE CRACKS OF TECHNOLOGY GREETINGS AND BLESSINGS FROM CDMX 🇲🇽🇲🇽 I NEVER MISS YOUR VIDEOS
Congratulations Mexico
Long live Mexico and long live a technonaut PS: From Sinaloa Mexico 🇲🇽
Long live Mexico!!!!! Greetings from Chile.
Long live Mexico! and what is missing is just the beginning! Greetings!
All motivated by the S23ULTRA
"Well, I hope you like it, it will be made with love from Mexico to the world Open time to celebrate 🇲🇽 And also to work 🇲🇽"
"I dont live near Monterrey but the day they want to come to Mexico they have their house insured, my house their house"
"Hello Technauts, greetings from Granada, Nicaragua. How I love their programs because of the spark they put into them. What a good double you do. Now I see that they cover all fields of technology, I think its excellent and long live not only Mexico but all of Latin America and Spain. That they are well"
"Here we are all your proud Mexican fans, Thank you technonauts🇲🇽"
"In Mexico there are people who refuse to build factories, they complain about anything"
"Its great that they talk and publish a bit of everything, I love your channel!!!"
Tremendous news for Mexico
"Until 2 days ago it was strictly forbidden to touch screens while driving and now it turns out that it is no longer dangerous and we can have 95% of the configuration and actions to be carried out in the car there, very good very good."
"Its terrifying, that a car can be approved with that steering wheel, and then any nonsense you do to your car will get you hit on everything."
You cannot use your mobile phone while driving but there are cars with up to 4 screens that you have to use even for reflexive actions such as putting on the wipers or the air conditioning
"The old consumption graph, the one you miss, is in the upper right tab"
"The thing about the doors is beautiful, yes, in my neighborhood I go 3 meters with the door open and before it closes they have ransacked my car, they take even the seats. Of course, the fixed steering wheel that is left untouched"
"Calero, I would like you to talk about cheaper cars, that most of us here do not even consider it. Although I appreciate you talking about these cars too."
"I think that this steering wheel only convinces those who like Gadgets more than driving, if you like to drive give me a real steering wheel, levers and buttons"
"Congratulations on the video. I am delighted with my Skoda tdi with 160,000 km and almost 5 years old and I plan to continue with it. And I am very happy, despite the fact that I share Caleros analysis 100%, with my new Tesla S."
"Tremendous, the steering wheel is one of the first driving safety rules: do not cross your arms. If the airbag goes off when you have your arm in front of your face... the first ends up embedded in the second"
"You have a consumption meter the same as before, only you have not been able to see it, it is on the same screen as the yellow graph, it changed in the penultimate update"
"Good morning, regarding what you indicate about the on-board computer, if you have a destination in the browser, the graph that you have shown and the traditional one that you commented on the kWh and, as a novelty, also the parked consumptions do appear. The first impression is strange but I prefer the current proposal to the one that was in previous versions"
"When many talk about resistance to change, they are able to value A.I. improving the picture of a great painter. The human hand may no longer paint with such perfection, but the merit lies in the ability to do so. The same goes for the pedals and the gear lever. You drive."
"I may be old fashioned but I need a normal steering wheel, levers and buttons..."
"It would be nice if you could tell us if many of those necessary screen touches could be avoided with voice commands, since a car of that power and price should implement it for safety. Some of the similarly priced Mercs sound like it to me. For the rest, as you usually get used to, good video."
"Id like to try that steering wheel. If the gear ratio is correct, I would put it on all vehicles, being safer in the event of a frontal impact. A new evolution of the steering wheel"
"David Hasselhoff at first with Kitt had a lot of problems driving it, but then he loved it. It even looks like he drives it with brutal ease That flyer is a nod to Knight Industries, the Knight 2000. Kitt if you prefer."
"Greetings to all. My opinion is that this vehicle, like all electric ones, is still early for them to be viable, as are the usual thermal ones. And as you write in the header of this video"
"Most of us dont have those problems, sorry for the proud owner."
The car was one of the few places where we returned to the real world when we momentarily stopped using a screen. It is a pity.
"The thing about the doors has made me think about what happens when you park in a parking lot with the neighboring car a short distance away, does the Tesla detect that proximity or open the door by hitting it?"
Gullwing doors are so dangerous in a rollover that almost all car manufacturers have rejected the idea of ​​continuing to use them on their vehicles. In this video we see the ingenious idea that Tesla engineers had to avoid this problem completely
"The truth is that Teslas are geniuses One question, did the tes!a pass the moose test?"
"Without watching the video, I can infer that it is because they have the batteries down, keeping the center of gravity very low and the car being quite wide."
I was already waiting for a new video thanks overdrive
"Lower center of gravity more difficult to tip over. But 2500 kilos, much more weight means much more wear on many parts and much more serious frontal accidents."
Tesla plus his 3 tons of batteries on the floor
"TESLA CONTINUES TO SURPRISE WITH ITS GREAT DESIGNS, IT GOES ONE STEP AHEAD... TO GIGANTIC LEAPS"
With a battery that weighs a ton and a half on the floor of the car... Youll tell me how to turn it back... Its like the seesaw we had when we were little where they placed a lead on the base and you could do whatever you want... .
"It has like 2 tons of batteries on the floor. That is a counterbalance for any centrifugal, centripetal, inertial force, gravitational potential and even natural disasters."
I want to see that car in the moose test
The overweight due to the batteries makes it very dangerous in a frontal crash for other users.
"Tesla is not all that sells you, it is a young company that has many shortcomings. at the level of production, construction and finishes."
By the heavy batteries on the floor
The tesla does turn over even if they say that they have not already seen the tesla turned over or when they are going to turn and it is on automatic pilot sometimes it does not measure the speed of rotation and overturns
"Yes, the electrical problems are others."
"1: There is not much engineering, the fact that it has 600kg only in the lower central part already gives it enough stability. 2: The problem with electric cars is accidents, as you mention, a perforation in a battery will cause it to catch fire and no, there is no circuit that can prevent that, and an aluminum cover will not prevent the fire from spreading, considering that aluminum melts at 660ºC and those batteries in which they set fire can reach more than 1000ºC in less than 10 seconds....."
"In summary: they dont even know how they did it, it just came out due to the construction and architecture of the tesla, which will naturally give it a low center of gravity"
"They dont know Mexican drivers, here they dump it because they dump it hahaha"
The same sand prevents me from coming back
For our pt cruiser
I find it hard to believe this is the first time they got hands on a model Y
I really hope Toyota doesn’t lose their way in the process of this. They must remember what got them their loyal customer base. Reliability!
"I find it really hard to believe that the biggest automotive manufacturer in the world would not only get to teardown of the leading EV manufacturers vehicle today and not years ago, but also openly admire the competitors tech."
My outdated 25 yr old Camry is advanced enough to still get me home.
This is a REALLY good thing. It means Toyota top engineers arent complacent and recognize the need for improvement and innovation.
It took a teardown to make them realize the complacency. It is bewildering.
"Guys remember, Toyota is very conservative and are very incremental in their quality analysis before coming out. They always knew Tesla technology but needed to have a dedicated EV platform to produce quality EV vehicles. Great job Kirk, always the best."
Once again phenomenal analysis Kirk. Awesome to see the Arene mention. It will be a big deal when Toyota can decouple the hardware and software production process and deliver high quality software over the air for a decade or more across their entire lineup. So many of their vehicles are held back by unfortunate software/infotainment quirks that are obscenely expensive or impossible to fix after delivery to customer. Arene fixes this and is key to a compelling EV product and future autonomous driving features.
"Hey Kirk, this is the best content you’ve put out since you started your channel. Good job you have come a long way"
"I love how they are careful which way to go forward with full EV production, as they always protect their quality control rep first."
Another video with some terrific insights into the challenges that Toyota/Lexus have in transitioning to EVs. Top video Kirk.
"This was really well informed. Great work. Samsung is the smallest of the Korean battery manufacturers, safe money is on SK, although who comes out with good solid state scaleability is still anyones guess."
"I always thought Japan was technologically advanced and hearing Toyota say Tesla, an American company, looked like alien technology is impressive"
"I honestly think hybrids are the best way to go. Full EVs are completely reliant on the power grid, which can be switched off and controlled easily by the powers-that-be. I love the autonomy of hybrids, with their increased power, efficiency, and fun without the full reliance on the (already outdated/stressed) power grid."
"Toyota as other Japanese Automakers needs to do what they did in the 60s and 70s, copy the best sellers, and make it better."
Hard to believe they have not watched all the teardowns already available on YouTube by Sandy Monroe. The cast body has not been a secret for a long time now and can be used in ICE cars as well.
"I had no idea Tesla’s sales in CA was so high, even passing the Camry and RAV4. Legacy behemoth companies usually can not turn the ship around (Xerox, Kodak, IBM etc). I would expect the K-cousins would be best positioned to take the top spot in the EV future then Toyota as they still seem pretty nimble."
Thx for your candid review of this subject. I am a fan of Toyota and look forward to their automobile(EV) innovations. Glad that Toyota sees the future of autos.
Great work. We have all been saying this for the last 5 yrs and its great to hear it from Toyota itself.
I wish only the best for Toyota. But it’s nice to see an American car company doing so well. I hope they both do well in the future. Right now if you make any good EV you will sellout because the market has not caught up with demand. This is why for at least the next five years any well made EV will sellout.
The best deals for your Tesla here: 
"Calero the videos are well directed, edited and narrated, but you have to look at the audio please. Many people record outdoors without much problem."
"The audio is not especially good. However, a lot of quality in the rest of the video. I hope it can be resolved soon. A hug"
"I expected a more TECHNICAL video, with a comparison at the level of consumption and weight vs. the Chinese version. Gig presses are supposed to substantially lighten the weight by eliminating welds and the structural battery, even not having the 4680 yet, should lighten as well. Have you been able to check or measure any of this?"
"Good video, Calero you are a super professional! Very nice car although today the electric ones are for the rich. All the best"
"Please Calero, try to solve the audio issue… Otherwise, good video."
"Juan, I am a subscriber from Romania. I watch your videos with pleasure, they are very well done, with a lot of useful information. I think theres still a bit of work to be done on the audio side, maybe another lavalier mic would help more. You are doing an incredible job, carwow is my favorite Youtube channel in Spain. Greetings."
"Maybe I was misled and you said it in the video... but what battery does this model have? Do you have the new ones? Congratulations for your work, in this channel and in particular for this video... Regards"
"how do you know you enjoy it! Very funny the jumps at the beginning. Calero, you make me love cars"
It is possible to do town charging in the Tesla model Y. I mean that they drag you 10Km (in case of emergency) to charge 100Km of autonomy.
Very good video Calero! Maybe you should have checked the door trim and trim tolerances that Tesla says are normal. I hope that this German model has the chassis welds correctly done. Uploading it to an elevator to check it underneath would have been the finishing touch.
"As for the software with respect to the Model 3, they are the same, when you tried it it was an earlier version, but updates come out, and the software is exactly the same, with the same appearance"
"I suppose that the measurements of the trunk are still without a tray, what is the capacity up to said tray?, which I think is the one that is really loaded."
"The issue of lights is linked to the fact that until recently in the United States the most advanced systems, such as adaptive ones, were not allowed"
I try to imagine the analysis of carwow with those of gtautomocion would be the definitive channel. I think that the two are very complementary. at least I dream of a meeting to talk about cars
It would be interesting to put him in a circuit and see his dynamic behavior but you would get a terrible impression.
excellent report
Good video with a lot of information of interest to future buyers.
"With the headphones on, it is true that the sound of the video leaves a lot to be desired, otherwise always great JF. My God, what an ugly interior... uffff. The comments are good, I loved the one from a colleague: if you like cars, dont buy a TESLA. Brutal :D"
Thank you for your reporting on this. Im just fascinated with the progress that Tesla is making and the direction theyre going.
I think this presentation was a compelling mission statement of their current status and a decently specific plan for how to revise manufacturing and implement battery solutions.
"I think pull through sites are going to solve this, and the towing issue. With software, they could easily tell you exactly which spot to park in depending on your vehicle. For existing locations that are not pull through they can still optimize things depending on which vehicles are there and showing up. Its possible they could reduce the number of blocked stalls down to just one. So I dont think this will actually be an issue, even though I thought it would be."
"As a Model Y driver, I hope they will have an owners‘ day in the future where they talk about spare parts availability, quality control, expansion of the body shop network, customer communication and service quality. If Tesla wants to keep customers they win from other manufacturers, they need to work on these aspects as well."
"Hi Ryan Here in the UK Tesla have opened 16 sites for non Tesla cars to charge. I believe the ones chosen are the chargers that in the past have been underused by Tesla owners so it makes sense to get a return on an under performing site. Will more be opened? who knows.but I think they will be. You make a valid point about some EVs having to take up more space because of the cable lengths. I have a Model 3 plus a Renault Zoe ev with the charging port at the front., so for me its not a problem to use the superchargers but for some it will be. Also in the UK the Tesla chargers have CCS type 2 plugs so no need for an adapter. Keep up the good work"
"I watched the event and appreciate your take on summarizing it. I was hoping for an update on when/if the features that were lost when the sonic sensors were removed would be restored but nothing and it is understandable with the focus being on the future more than present issues. More info on the build-out of GFNV to grow the Semi production plus 4680 productions there would have been nice also but nope. Watching the price of TSLA fall today is normal following any positive news Tesla provides so no surprise there. Thanks for your efforts, Ryan!"
Consistently and unbelievably useful summary of Tesla and the EV space. Thanks my man!
"Ryan, your synthesis of Investors’ Day is the best I’ve watched yet; very cogent and short … thank you!"
Do you think that Tesla will make a Model Y performance model with the 4680 batteries? I wonder what kind of range/performance that would bring to the table.
Pretty excited about the changeover to 48 volts. Long overdue considering the last time they upgraded from 6 volts was 1960.
Well weve used our Ioniq 5`s V2L capabilities a lot by now. Id love to be able to used the Teslas battery while camping.
"I think its somewhat of a smart move to open up some charging points to other evs, probably ones that are not being used too much. I would be charging non-Tesla users a significant premium to utilize, maybe 2x, otherwise you are just providing a charging network for the lazy ICE vehicle manufacturers."
03:00 they not only block the spot next to him but also the cable is to short and the car has to be careful to move forward a few inches. But as theyve said theyre going to extend the cables for v4 SuC. But weve got that fun now for a many months in Europe and no problems so far.
Im wondering about the possibility of a ccs extension cord. Probably would be a bulky thing to haul around because it would have to be oversized with no cooling.
The newest supercharger in my area has half of the chargers where you back in and half where you pull forward and the charger is 6 feet away from the curb. I wonder if this is why they did it. This station opened a month ago.
Great videos! Cant wait for the Cybertruck; keep that news coming!
"Ryan, great rundown of the investor day event! Thank you! Now if only I can convince my wife that we need a cyber truck!"
"Predictive air suspension would be very nice. Though it will be for S and X only, for now."
I dont know why people expected exciting announcements from investor day. Its gonna be dense business stuff. And once we dig into it probably more exciting than its entertainment/face value
"Tesla can sell an extension cable and charge a premium if they want. I am still waiting and watching before getting an ev. Might start with an EV scooter. However, it was surely a lot more easier to tune my diy e skate mountain board via VESC Tool. A lot easier to tune than an ICE using a full aftermarket ecu. Very excited about the tuning scene for the EV market. AEM has a head start on this already."
0-267 (vmax) in 14s. Thats actually faster than my first car 0-100.
4.5 seconds from 90-220 that is actually insane
"The feeling of the acceleration in this car is insane. At first it feels fast, but then your mind can’t comprehend that the acceleration continues and continues, you go into a fight or flight mode. It’s wild. I was lucky enough to experience it first hand."
Its like playing videogames on mute
"I like that you can hear his breathe exhale sharply during the 0-62 run at 2:13 Im sure this has also happened in other brutally fast cars like the 992 911 GTS and Turbos, you just couldnt hear him take a breath like that with the engine and exhaust note"
1:18 is a perfect demonstration of this cars insane speed. look at how it closed the gap with the hatchback
The 0-200 is completely INSANE!!!!!
"The most impressive thing is when hes waiting for the Corsa to change lanes, he starts accelerating from about 110 when the car in front starts the lane change, and by the time he passes it hes doing 200+"
"If you ever drive a Tesla youll understand. The power is insane. Like, the power band didnt stop. Its straight up force in your seat the whole time with instant speed zero lag"
As a young man I never would have imagined there‘d ever be a car that fast and yet so unenthusiastic.
Insane torque ! Can feel the G force that take some part from your breath
Plaid driver since December here. I absolutely love this car. Topspeed on the autobahn in track mode is 285. In track mode the battery is also conditioned for peak performance.Problem is that the suspension in track mode is just too hard and you can only set this mode when standing still in park.
0-260 in 11s
I love the colour combination the red and black fist it so well!
Insane acceleration!!! Can it now maintain its top speed for fast cruising? I wonder if and when the advertised top speed is unlocked.
"Mother of god, its like the speed of light...insane."
"Nice video bro! Can you make a Drive Test and drive it normally? That would be very awesome, especially in a big city with traffic!"
Rear view on autobahn would be lovely.
You should film Model S Plaid with speed limiter off. That would be ideal for your channel. This one is also sick tho.
"It has no soul but damn its fast. I do like the wheel, for long legged people like me it should make it very comfortable to have clearance, and also the gauges would have fantastic visibility. In every car I have ever driver, because I need the wheel up high, the bottom info of the gauges are obscured. EVERY car. Would love to try this and see the difference."
"If the budget adjusted to the price, I would definitely buy it!"
Congratulations gabo your excellent reviews are among the best in Latin America
"What good reviews, Ive been seeing you for 4 years and I still like what you do"
I cant imagine what the aesthetics of the Peugeot 2008 would be with the technology of this Tesla Y. Excellent video. Thank you :)
"It is an excellent vehicle, price vs performance, I have the extended range version and so far I think I made a good purchase. The interior finishes are of quality but not the best. But still, this Tesla is the most accessible in the segment, and for the moment it is the best option. In this segment with a price in the United States of 57,190 USD, with the auto pilot."
I love it I was waiting for the review for months ️️
"Good evening, very good video, thank you. Could you please talk in a video about the electric charger network in Mexico?"
amazing car. I hope it arrives in Spain soon!!
"Just like the model 3 does not stop reminding me, excessively, of the one they called all new mazda 3 from about 10 years ago, it is still a sensational car, 100% desirable"
It looks very sporty and spacious! This is great I love Tesla! I hope to have one of those soon
"Thanks for the review, one question, what is the height from the floor of model 3 and model y?"
"Excellent car, excellent review. I am becoming more and more convinced to buy a Tesla Model Y."
A Tesla review comes out Gabo: ️
very nice car and definitely Tesla has his motto or design style
"Just last month I got my model Y, Im super happy with it and I wouldnt change it for anything. Its range surprised me a lot, I took it from Monterrey to Puerto Vallarta on the highway, obviously with stops to load it but super good."
"You should talk about the dangerous design of the back door releasers. We already know that the front doors have two releases, the electric push button, and the manual one in case the electric one doesnt work. The design of the rear door releases is somewhat dangerous as the manual releases are placed in a location that is impossible to access in a pinch. Here in the US They have been criticized a lot for that design. I hope they change it soon."
"Make a video explaining the lease payment method, thank you."
4:07 What is most appreciated in reviews is honesty.
"Beyond the fact that acceleration is a ""party trick"" and that in the curves it feels like a heavier car, I think these are cars for daily use, not for playing little races. Acceleration is important because in situations like entering a fast lane it is very necessary."
Very modern but excessively minimalist. So minimalist that it makes you wonder if it really costs that money.
Earlier we used to play car games and now the game is in the car itself.
"the best things about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something. He always respect us, the Audience, and his team, and he is always polite in all of his videos. We congratulations ourselves this achievement. More to come and everything to come..."
5:50 transition was so smooth
This Is Called Quality Content BTW.... Love from Delhi..!
LEtS we all just appreciate the content this man and his crew makes its just a masterpiec imagine whats hes gonna doing the future ️
Amazing review with amazing car what a masterpiece engeneering from TESLA
The stamina he got...Its incredible
"I love how his voice is fricking deep, but his personality is a whole different level, from sounding mean and rude. to actually being sweet and nice."
Really your journey from reviewing small electronics products-smart Phone-laptops-3D printers now Worlds primium cars helicopters Opppppp
Congratulations For 10M

"We absolutely love our 3 after 4 months, and can’t wait to get our Y soon (8 month wait). I wish we could keep both. Our 3 has had no issues, on delivery or afterwards. I think they are definitely working on the quality issues. And like you said, you could get more range if you drove without so much acceleration, but that’s no fun. Lol"
"Thank you. Excellent, down to earth, short, concise, get to the point review. As another commenter mentioned, I agree with you 100%. Keep up the great job!"
"Hi I havent gone through all your videos yet, but based on build quality, functionality and range alone, which EV would be at the top??Or how would you position them from most desirable to least desirable??"
"Thanks for the honest review. I will also be trading in my white/black 3P for a white/white YP (possibly this week). There are definitely quirks you have to deal with owning a Tesla (silly panel fitment, no CarPlay, etc.) but I do love the minimalist interior, the buying experience and quite a few other things."
"Great review! Done very well. FYI Model Y performance 0-60 is way higher than the 3.2 you mentioned :P. Model 3 is 3.1 for the performance and in top best conditions with rollout removed. Seriously though, out of the hundreds of reviews Ive watched this was a great, fair and honest review. Well done."
Great honest straight to the point review! I haven’t come across a review that doesn’t mention design flaws or early month service tickets. This is the only thing stopping me from buying a Tesla
"Ive had my MYLR for nearly a year (Sept 2021). I managed to jump on a demo car in existing inventory - which means I have an extra order (which is still pending!). As much as I love the car, there are a few nit-picks - which you already mentioned. Also, my config has increased by over 13K. I think I would have second thoughts at that price point. I really wish the MY had variable or air suspension - at least as an option. It rides like a sports car, which is fine for the Performance model but the LR trim should be about range and comfort. I would love Car Play as an option too. I put in an aftermarket CarPlay media player in my Corolla and it is great - but thats now my daughters college car."
I just drove a model three for the first time today after selling my 2022 3 series back to the dealer. Im surprised that nobody talks about how uncomfortable the model three seats are for tall people. The seat cushion needs to be at least another 3 inches longer or at least have an extension option. Its potentially a deal killer for me
Love this review. The first I’ve heard of many of these pros and cons. Appreciate your contribution on the Tesla Y research!
One of the best and most articulate reviews I have watched!...thank you for taking the time to do the video. Very helpful! :-)
"What charging levels are you referring to, when you provide us the three range scenarios? Is it 100% to 20%? Or is it 100% to 5 %?. Please let me know. Good review! Thank you!"
"Exactly, there are other options out there for an EV. In my looking around at the other options - Ford MachE, Kia EV6, etc. Those cars were serious contenders. But to get their vehicle as close to the same build as Tesla as possible - AWD, the longest range you can get with their car, and by the time the unscrupulous dealers mark it up you are paying Tesla prices. So, at least for me if I am going to pay Tesla prices I may just as well buy the Tesla. Especially since the Tesla is widely regarded as being years ahead of the competition in their technology as well as experienced in this new platform of electric vehicles ."
"Great review, in 5 years the market is going to look so much better IN the EV space mainly due to expected improvements in tech"
"Excellent review, I think there should be traditional knobs and buttons for most used functions, like the fan or the wipers, currently having balancing issues, which the dealer does not cover under warranty. But over all love my 2021 model Y. But I think the thing that sets teslas apart from the other evs is the supercharger network on long distance routes."
Awesome review Sir. Really enjoyed it.. One of the best Tesla review videos I have ever seen..
"We all need more of these kinds of real-life, customer reviews. I drive less than 20 miles per day in mostly excellent warm weather in SC. Kevin, after viewing your video I decided not to purchase a FISKEER EV I had booked and went for a Hybrid RAV4! less than half the model Y or fisker Ocean price, and neat features. The fenders reportedly stay in place, and the vehicle gets a lot done with radars and fewer cameras, making simple repairs not expensive. Just imagine the cost of repairing a fender-bender on a Y. Those crazy number of sensors will make repairs extremely expensive and even unreliable."
"Great honest user review. I have a few acquaintances that own Model X’s, and guess what? The front fenders pop off on those too. Apparently its a known issue, and they were told the same thing. Just snap them back on."
"Very interesting insight. I do think Tesla seems to escape a lot of criticism in relation to fit, finish and reliability. No other manufacturer would get away with producing cars with misaligned panels etc without it being a major story. Jeez - Jaguar is still paying for this decades after it stopped even being an issue."
"Good honest review. We are expecting our Tesla soon and our mind set was get a Tesla now because of the “ecosystem” and then as other manufacturers develop their EV ecosystem, start looking around. Good review again."
"Excellent review. I just ordered a model Y. Your real world, balanced observations are very helpful. Thanks"
"The desire to have a Tesla definitely left me. Thanks Angel, yours is worth gold."
"The quality of the Tesla, even though it annoys its fans, leaves much to be desired."
"Bravo Pedrito, for more kids like this, with an attitude to learn and next to a great Angel"
"From all my heart; finally a mechanic in good condition, because I swear that when you take the car to the workshop, you leave with fear of seeing how it comes out of there..."
"Channels like this are appreciated where, regardless of peoples opinion, things are said if they are good or bad. Great job and keep it up"
I dont understand anything about mechanics but your explanations are perfectly understandable and on top of that its a joy to see a professional who enjoys his work. Subscribed!!!
"That noise when turning happened to me and the people in the workshop went crazy to look for it, thinking that it was the typical transmission... ball joints, etc... after 3 weeks of assembling and disassembling parts they realized that it was something much simpler . a wheel bearing"
"Mine with 76,000 km I put it in a box, and it has almost all of the front silent blocks cracked, including the engine one. The front bearings with clearances, the right much more than the other. The oil leak from the rear seal is the same as in this video."
damn its nice to see that there are people who still work well
"I just discovered your videos, your model3 case, your channel. Hats off, you do a great job, Im happy for your victory against the Tesla Goliath. Well done and go ahead."
Heres someone who was planning to buy a Tesla model Y and gets out of the car thanks to you. Keep it up
"I want to work in a workshop like this, legal, sincere and without nonsense"
Keep uploading videos you are the only mechanic from head to toe on all of Youtube
"Hello Ángel, I studied mechanics and it always fascinated me, now with your videos I am catching up... always learning, regards"
"Thank you Ángel for this piece of video, at first I didnt like the mechanics, but thanks to the fact that you appeared on tiktok I have become curious to at least know the basics, thank you very much and regards"
"Uncle gaitan you are a crack from your videos I learn a lot, not only from Tesla. The longer your videos, the better Ill have it. How lucky who can learn with you"
"Thank you Angel for an excellent program, talk to us openly so that we dont fall for fools with these unscrupulous manufacturers. Greetings from Puerto Rico. A hug."
"Great work friend, I have loved the way you progress in the video and explain to inexperienced people like me, how you play and why you do it. You are a Crack !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Very good video angel. I really like this type of review regardless of the car, since one learns to see where it may have faults or deduce a little what it may be and learn more. Greetings!."
"Upload more of these videos, I love watching you work, disassembling cars and telling the truth"
A past how good the installation is.
"Hello, have you done any work with the seats, so that an older person can get into the passenger seat more easily? Could the seat be made to turn 90 degrees towards the doors like motorhomes?"
A job taking care of detail. I like it!! Thanks for sharing.
"It looks great, but I have plenty of seats and speakers"
"The truth is that you do an impeccable job. I wont hesitate to bring the car to you as soon as I have my Tesla. I would also be interested in installing a screen behind the wheel as a dashboard, would it be possible? Thank you"
That last!! Can you indicate prices?
"Great job. In addition to led, you install some other equipment (sound, multimedia). For example, the steering wheel screen or the rear screen that they sell for model 3 and model and in the aerators? Thank you"
"One question, do you also install an LCD screen behind the wheel that can complement the central screen? Thank you."
Very cool. Some questions. Are the front side moldings and the one on the dashboard available in finishes other than wood?
Price without speakers?
The seats are very cute... the rest is very good..... how much does that affect battery consumption?

"Glad that you figured out how to engage the autopilot! ;-) You can set it that you have to either press the scrollwheel once to engage cruise control and to press again to engage autopilot, or to press once and go directly to autopilot! Also, for the horn, you can place your whole hand on the right area of the yoke to horn, instead of just pushing that small horn-icon!"
"Teslas are very fascinating, only people who have driven or own the car can understand that. Haters have never dealt with it, let alone driven or owned one"
I dont even use the yoke in my Model S. Full Self Driving beta takes pretty much all of my turns for me!
02:58 I see you instinctively went to push the indicator stalk down. I imagine it will take a lot of adjustment.
Thanks for the updates Dan
"Better video, better car, good job Elon"
Looks awesome... Love to see the new Model X too
Goodness.. that steering wheel. Must be maddening to get use to.
Yoke steering wheel looks good
Huge car performance
Your accent is so cute
Im not as concerned as I was of the lack of a drive stalk as I was before watching the video but the indicator buttons still seem suboptimal.
Amazing car this Tesla plaid S ya got here n cool vlog info
"Im not judging the geniuses who made this master piece of technology, but that steering wheel is a terrible idea in my records."
Nice
"I LOVE tesla cars! the best engine and batteries on the market , but this yoke steering is horrible and unsafe"
"I’m so opportune that irrespective of the economy crisis and financial conditions I am still able to earn $19,500. Success so far on my trades."
"I mean they just recalled near 400,000 of them you most certainly should be having your hand on the steering wheel"
"With VW, BMW, Mercedes heavily investing in solid state battery technologies these cars will soon be dinosaurs, like old game consoles flooding the market for no money. Im gonna drive my audi diesel for another 5+ years without problems and only get on the EV train when the german makers start putting in the new batteries with ranges over 600+ miles (965 km) in around 2030. See you then and until then, if you really want it get these cars only on as a company lease, never ever invest your own money for this expensive headache, youll soon regret it."
HIGH MORALES!!!
Good afternoon Alexander
"We Are Always Fixing Nonsense (SEAT), We Are Always Fixing Long Nonsense (TESLA), that, well, give it to Tesla, we prefer SEAT... Alejandro, honey and lemon and warm white wine all and rasss, take care"
Further ? Put it on the list...
I dont know Rick...
Video of the BYD burning?
TESLA YOU ARE PLAYING
That voice is better.
Dont you see what Spain is?
"Love your vids, Andy. Getting my Model 3 in 5 days, and Im beyond excited!!"
"I have my Tesla, a 2021 Model 3 SR+, which I lovingly refer to as my “poor man’s Tesla.” (I’m a retired elementary school teacher.) Yes, it is the least expensive, shortest range, slowest, and smallest Tesla made."
Another very good and informative Video. I am planning to buy Tesla Model 3 RWD this week. You said that all Tesla Model 3 has sentry mode with 128GB HYD in the glove box for the sentry mode recording. I read somewhere that sentry mode is country dependent. Pls confirm that that sentry mode feature is also available in Tesla Model 3 supplied and sold in Canada. Thanks.
Love the Y but hate the dash board or lack of one. Do you have any experience with the dash installed after you receive the car?
Great video with so much info!
Well summarized Andy. Do you think it’s worth waiting for HW4 before placing an order?
Great review of the entire range. Thx
"I notice that you can get a used tesla for a fraction of the cost and that it comes with Full self-driving as well. No need to pay 15,000. This something people should look into, I know I will buy mine used the mileage is not bad as well."
Im selling my 2022 Y LR. Purchased in October. Love it but need more range. 23 Model X LR I hope will make the 250 mile commute easier. Y is fine above 50 degrees but wont make it without stopping to charge under 45 degrees
"You mention you can choose between the wall charger and the mobile charger, but, they dont include either anymore, right?"
"This could be stupid, guess I could do the math, but does charging phones take up battery that may be needed for range? Good vid!"
I have a question for Elon would it be a good idea for a ev to be able to pull in to a station have a robot pull a battery out from under the vehicle and replace it with a charged one. Simotainlesly charging the customer a fee and they could be on their way more efficiently than charging
In the tesla app the my cost shows the order fee subtracted out of the final price.
How has the removal of the Ultrasonic Sensors from the bumper without Tesla Vision being ready for use affected safety? No parking assist and you lose a lot of features of Autopilot and Enhanced Autopilot that you paid for without them.
If i had the money for one i would get the model x plaid
"Millions of people in Europe, are postoning the change to EVs, waiting for Tesla. Streets are very narrow, so people that can afford a Model 3 orY, await a compact model 2(That Elon named Highland) say like VW Golf size, but with driving specs like M3. If the compact car also comes at the half price, that will activate a huge demand, that would exceed all other models comebined, which is the goal in 2023. A refresh of a 5 year old M3, simply cant do that. Elon: In 2023, we will focus on a mindblowing upscaling of production, and not so much on profit. So dont expect any nieche products."
"I tried to talk myself into going the EV route but after 6 months of learning all I could about Tesla, I just couldn’t feel good about it. I do believe Tesla is the only EV to go with simply because of the Tesla Supercharger network but at the the end of the day it just wasn’t enough. I still think it’s kool technology."
"Model Y, best deal out there right now but not for long…"
The revised epa mileage for Tesla I believe is bogus.
I am 74 years old. The Model Y with slightly higher seats than the M3 is easier for me to get in and out of.
"2 N/mm stands for ""2 Newton per millimeter"" and describes how much difference of force the springs absorbs per millimeter it is compressed - compared to the older configuration. It simply means they reduced the force necessary to compress the spring by 1 millimeter. It may not sound much but will be a great difference in feel."
"Gjeebs has a video on the ride comparison of Ys vs newer models with the ""comfort"" suspension. While not apples-apples, my 2021 3SR+ (with 19"" Sport wheels) rides significantly stiffer and doesnt take bumps well vs my 2023 Y (with 20"" Induction wheels) rides so nice! It takes bumps well, but still is firm. TBH, I really like the ride and suspension."
I got my Tesla Model Y long range in mid-Feb. The ride is really smooth compared to when I test drove a year before.
"My 2023 MYP recently got the update with the ""comfort"" suspension, not sure if i can tell a difference to be honest."
I hope this is from jan 2023 and not after Jan 23. I’m waiting for my delivery in the next 2 weeks MY LR from Shanghai ( Delivery to Europe) and I beliefs was built some time in Jan 23.
"Even with ""Comfort Suspension"" it still is not much better than the previous versions."
"Very good video. Cheer up with the trips, have a good time and waiting for more videos. Happy week ️️️"
Nothing like a good excursion through the green Bavaria with the Galician spider crab!
"Good video as always, the landscape resembles Galicia...a bit, and the fridge in Spain would have simply been taken away, cheeses, coins and a fridge that was also a good brand. Lets keep having fun and having fun. Greetings."
"Videos like this are the most real and practical since not all of us use the vehicle to go on highways from A to B. And you see the real drawbacks of day to day or trips inside. Greetings from Euskadi, also green."
"Good!!! two videos this week. how green!! Congratulations with the videos. One question, have you put a protector on the screen? does it scratch?"
Speeding up the marches...
Very instructive video. Of so many videos that there are... I have not seen any traveling 4 people. Good video. You are a crack. Greetings
"I saw something similar but with a bouquet of flowers. They are different mentalities. Thats like the American newspaper dispensers. In Spain they would even take the dispenser. By the way, its a pity that Tesla has removed the issue of referrals. Goodbye to the 1500km supercharger."
"Hello Gallego, I dont miss any of your videos, Im one of your first subscribers and I told you that I would buy a Tesla with your code who if I have to convince is my wife hehehe lets see if you give her a hold on yours so that decide"
Hahaha You put it in Spain and they carry the entire fridge
It is rumored that you also spent another exit from the charger to Munich
squeezing!!!!!
If Julia didnt play videogames so much you would arrive fixed!
"You will have to repeat it!! Besides, with those Bavarian landscapes, you dont need any more excuses... Im even considering it myself!"

"Wow - I like this 12 minute format - lots of info! (next number and create a playlist). These videos are your Tesla Gen 2 of videos - saving time and money! Plus, you can cut an hour version together too!"
"Excellent, fantastic presentation, understood everything. Thank you."
This all sounds like great news… too bad it takes so long to get everything going!
"Great presentation. Ive engineered 44 years in big auto testing / making wire harnesses. As long as you had 12v incandescent bulbs that blow and needed replacing you were never going to bring in 48v systems. Bulbs! what are they, now LEDs dont blow you have no need to manage the repair market, open the doors to 48v apart form $$$$$ of teir 1, 2, 3 suppliers who were waiting to see who blinked first.....Tesla blinked......the rest will follow."
Most rich people stay rich by spending like the poor and investing without stopping then most poor people stay poor by spending like the rich yet not investing like the rich but impressing them
Excellent presentation. I was overwhelmed by the presenters. And thanks !
"Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!! Despite the economic downturn, Im so happy have been earning $ 60,000 returns from my $7,000 investment every 10days.."
this is your best video yet! Loved the deep analysis & its crazy to think we could see 700million teslas produced from a model that doesnt even exist yet!
Looking forward for the future! Technologies to reduce footprint and increase efficiency!
"They can’t fully utilise the teslabot in the current manufacturing process, so they’ve redesigned it. If they pull this off, it will change everything"
"Is the new process about one vehicle model or ALL models - new ones and current models redesigned? Why would Tesla figure out how to build cars at half the cost, reduced space, etc. and not apply that to all of its fleet going forward? So, this isn’t about THE new car, rather the new PROCESS for all cars."
Henry Ford’s assembly line had every section working in parallel with only the vehicles moving in sequence so it’s a mistake that many YouTube creators have made to say it was sequential and therefore inefficient.
Very smart concept
"Like the car on your cover ,its perfect"
Good job
Looks like the new vehicle may be a 1-series esque
"Dude(s), i LOVE your channel(s)! Really! every time you post new videos, i am happy to watch these great fabricated news reels! seriously! Hat! Thank you very much for being too strong and always very knowledgeable! It makes me happy. Come on, keep it up!"
NOT motor will cost $1000 less! They said motor cost reduced to $1000 all in
Do you think it will only be 1 vehicle on the 25k platform or they only have 1 vehicle design to be used on that platform for now
"Oysters, now I realize that the model Y rim under the hubcap is not so ugly, I thought it was like that and I had to ask for the tuberlle."
"Honestly, regarding Tesla, I think that Alejandro is making an effort in the last few days that must be assessed. There are no longer derogatory comments that did not fit with the mood that I consider this channel had."
When will we have these security elements in the cuckoo clocks? What is the only thing I can afford?
Hello very good morning my friend away
It is no longer surprising that the Chinese pass the EuroNcap tests. Good for competition and low prices.
"Well, in the video of the pedestrian walking, it has been too tight, I would say, and depending on the Angle you see, there is a shot, which suggests that if the pedestrian does not follow the path, Tesla eats it with potatoes at 2 :48, almost almost, but no, even so, since the road is not smooth, I dont trust that it wont take me ahead"
Eager to see how the MG4 goes.
VAAAAMOOOOOO
Perhaps it is that there are many haters who only do elaborate tests to create bad press….
"Good news! Thanks for the news, Alexander."
"Hi, where is the 10am video?"
"I dont like the Tesla, but a marvel in safety."
"Well today I want to congratulate you, Im not always going to give you a hard time when you speak ill of Tesla, or it seems that you get sick of the bad news, regards"
Got a Model 3 Performance. I think it’s an A+ daily driver that’s still sporty fun and super high tech w/o a drop of gas and almost zero maintenance. Congrats being back in the Tesla fam
"Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!! Despite the economic downturn, Im so happy have been earning $ 60,000 returns from my $7,000 investment every 10days.."
"The Tesla Model X was at the top of my wish list for years...until I started looking closer and learned about Teslas ongoing quality problems. Tesla has been building cars for about 15 years now and theyre STILL delivering some of the worse build quality in the industry. They use economy car materials while charging luxury car prices. And 8 times out of 10, the thing is damaged and/or falling apart on delivery to the new owner. And thats not to mention that Tesla was just rated as one of the least reliable EVs on the road. So, I get that you sold the Rivian to make a profit, but I think you seriously downgraded in quality of vehicle. Heres hoping it doesnt leave you stranded."
What’s the name of the shop that wrapped your Model Y? They hit it out of the park!!
Omg that wrap is amazing. Love it.
I’ve had my model Y for over a year and love it. Good family car! Great decision.
Put a swivel screen on it. It’s just a bracket
8:05 lol! 423Wh/mi! No wonder it drained fast! You should be able to get under 300 Wh/mi if you drive normal. I think you will find the Y gets much better efficiency.
Great buy
"Need an update later on FSD, battery, interior (white, stains?), and anything else!"
"Battery has not improved. I love my Tesla, but the battery drains so quickly. Seems like every time I get in it even to drive around town for a while I knock 80 miles off the battery going maybe 10 miles and mine is a 2023."
Your model X probably had such bad rang because your power consumption was at 423 wh/mi!! I have a Model 3 and my power consumption is at 220wh/mi! Anything thats near or around 210-250 is good
Bro the wrap looks amazing!!! I want that! Enjoy the model Y.
How did you get the tax credit? Its under the business?
8:49 the performance may be only a few grand more. But the 21” sport tires are going to be much more expensive to replace every 30k miles so that’s a cost the average person needs to consider. Tesla tires are already expensive.
"Didn’t you file sec 179 for the rivian? Did you fully depreciate the R1S? Because if you did, doesn’t that defeat the purpose of claiming it for your taxes?"
"what happened to the BTH vlogs, loved those"
"I drive for uber. The range of a Teslas are a deal breaker for me. I drove one for months, and it was a no go for me."
reasons he switched starts 
"Its always interesting to hear about personal experiences and preferences when it comes to electric vehicles. While the Rivian R1S and Tesla Model Y are both impressive vehicles with their own unique features and benefits, it ultimately comes down to what works best for each individual. Its important to do your research and test drive different models before making a decision, and this video offers some valuable insights into the pros and cons of each vehicle."
"5:08 But officer, I HAD to go 137mph so I could GET my registration to show you!"
"The tesla steering ""wheel"" looks good, but is dangerous as fuck. The classic round steering wheel is a better design because it enables you to grab the steering wheel from any angle. Its more accessible, especially when you need to quickly grab the wheel with both hands to do a last munite maneuver to avoid something."
"The biggest problem with putting the controls on the yoke - or even on traditional wheels - is that the controls you might happen to need may be in the totally wrong position when you need them, depending on where the wheel happens to be. In the case of the controls for functions like turn signals or lights, placement on the wheel could cause an accident. They belong in a non-rotating position."
Love how innovative Tesla and Elon is in general. But sometimes there just is no reason to full reinvent the wheel.
"My neighbor has one of these, and gave me a ride today. It’s absolutely INSANE. I think the interior is awesome, the yoke is so-so, but otherwise the tech is amazing. Not to mention it’s incredibly quick. I felt the blood shifting to the back of my body. You can pull a G on a public road. THAT is madness."
Do you think they could fix that with a software update? They could just disable the touch on the wheel as one turns. It does make me interested in certain small decisions with those items.
"Simple, critical analysis. That’s why I love this guy’s reviews."
"I always appreciate your clear, balanced reviews, MB. You are so thoughtful and well spoken. If I ever had the balls to create a YouTube channel reviewing the tech thats part of my daily handle, I will spend a serious amount of time reviewing all the fantastic parts of how well your channel works. Truly enjoy watching your videos!"
"Man, I don’t often envy the luxuries that wealth affords (mansions, boats and the like) but the new Teslas make me feel a slight pang of regret that I can’t afford to experience this amazing tech."
"Marques, Im a newcomer to your channel. Man, you are very thorough, very honest, and very real in your day-to-day reviews of EVs...Loved the F-150 Review, Loved the Rivian review, and loved this review. Great job staying objective for the weary and interested but more importantly to yourself! Great Job young man!"
"Fantastic review! I love the car. The yoke steering wheel will be a learning curve like the key card, door handles, and having a giant touch screen instead of dials and buttons. It might take more than a few days to get used to all of the new functions. But the horn really should be where the airbag is. But then again, with further FSD updates coming, the perceived issues may get resolved through automation."
"Honestly speaking, I am for everything in this new model; however, I am against the new yoke; almost everyone has experienced this; if youre making a sharp turn that requires nearly 360 rotation sometimes, you slip grabbing the steering wheel, and youll get hold of it pretty first because its round. With this, I believe that its not that easy to grab the yoke if you slip, and thats risky. Again, the horn they should have just stuck with the old method; how long will It take me to locate that button and I am also keeping my eyes on the road for some fools trying to cut me off at an exit or some dudes trying to cross when the lights are already green, thats an emergency situation, and I need my eyes on the road."
"This car seems like a whole lot of ""engineering solutions to problems that dont really exist""..."
"Another great review so thanks for posting! Consideration for a departure from a wheel has been discussed since drive-by-wire was introduced. I wish I could find the source, but there’s been talk of introducing a joystick similar to what you see in some newer aircraft. So yes, designers have ‘presumably‘ toyed with how to implement left and right-hand (dual stick) modes. The only drawback that I found in this omitted video assessment is the costs."
"Dear Marque, that was a ""word class"" description about the most weird decisions Tesla engineers and marketing took.. the yoke. Really I enjoyed so much the way you approached and describe your experience with the steering wheel."
A really great review Marques. First time on this channel and impressed with your knowledge and thoughts on the Plaid. Keep up the good work.
"Hey would you take a yoke steering with buttons, but as a remedy to the forward/reverse issue, institute a jet pitch mechanism? Like maybe have a locking feature so it’s not accidentally triggered when you’re driving down the road, but after releasing it would allow you to push to go forward, or pull to reverse I think that would be interesting"
As usual for you this review adds in so much detail that everyone else misses. Thanks Marques!
The story about your registration getting sucked into the abyss then shot out like a receipt was sending me my man
"I think the yoke its self is fine as well and its the buttons that are a problem. The big one for me is the horn. The horn is something that you need to be able to use in an instant. I can think of many times where I was cut off and if I honked a second later, I would of been hit."
"Lol I loved the part where she was like, “that’s not getting off until I get my screen protector “ smart idea. I bet she made you Vinyl wrap the entire car too to protect that paint which is actually a good idea in the long run."
"Congratulations , welcome to the Tesla family! I took delivery of my 2020 Model 3 at the Brentwood store in 2020 and drove it home to Memphis , what a great feeling! The staff there was awesome through test drives , order and delivery ! Enjoy!"
congrats on the new car. Ive had mine for one month today and absolutely love it!
"Congrats! You will be thankful for the black interior with 3 boys! I have had my model 3 black/black for almost 4 yrs and still love it. My 3 boys have definitely put some wear and tear on the seats but they clean up pretty easily. Convinced hubs to go all electric. Waiting to take delivery of our Y LR next month. Of note, when I ordered my 3 in March 2019, the initial estimated delivery date was June. However, I was assigned a VIN number and took delivery 2 weeks later. I think it was a car someone preordered and declined delivery on. Tesla definitely makes driving kids around more fun!"
Congrats! I picked up my MY LR last week and everything was great for the most part! What did you end up doing about the multiple spots where plastic is coming out from the interior roof glass? My MY also had that small issue but it was way more minor (2 spots).
Well made video and great recommendations. Keep the great content coming!
Congratulations!!! how exciting . Thanks for letting us accompany you in this journey! We look forward to our delivery and are looking for insight. We’ll be sure to inspect b4 we accept!
Very cool and welcome to the club! We are on our 3rd Tesla - the buying experience is so cool and different than any other car company. Congrats and enjoy!
Congrats Kate! I am still waiting for mine next month.
Congratulations I just got mine 2 weeks ago 7 seaters and downgraded from a mini van as well. I also have 3 boys we originally ordered white with black interior but settled with white on white same reason as you but we love it. Enjoy your new ride
congrats on the new car! i thought i was thorough when i got mine but your husband had an entire clipboard checklist
"I’ m so happy for you. We’re taking delivery of our M3 tomorrow Feb.25, so excited! Same colour!"
Love the color and black interior. I dont think i can handle white and nitpick it getting dirty.
"Great feeling isnt it? I should take a video of my 3 Tesla - M3 (black) and 2 MY LR (midnight silver n blue) from 2022 deliveries. Its tempting! Anyways enjoy your Model Y its fun, relaxing and compelling to drive compared w/ my 2 MBenz that I sold both prior to my Tesla deliveries to empty my driveway...lol"
"Hi Kate, Congratulations on your new Telsa Love this content."
Congratulations on your new car!
"Congratulations, I picked mine up same color but white interior. I guess we’re twinning lol."
"Congrats! Ive been getting the itch to buy a Tesla since my car is 13 years old. What did you do with your current vehicle? Did you trade it in and if so, did you get a good trade in value?"
Congrats! Nice color and wheels. Please review how tesla vision is working instead of ultrasonic sensors when your car closes to objests. Thanks
Those Pacifica seats
Love your videos
"Youve experienced my worst fear about owning a Tesla - the screen blacks out or just doesnt respond to any touches! Thanks for covering pretty much most of the pros and cons of owning a Model X, which could also apply to other Tesla models as well."
"FYI, dont slam the frunk lid. Lower down slowly and then use both hands to push it down to latch it. The frunk lid is very light material and if you slam it down, it can bent."
Wow this is so far the most honest and balanced review about TESLA. Good Job Girl!
This was the most genuine and honest Tesla review Ive ever seen. You showed the good and bad and gave honest opinions without glossing over the obvious QC problems and system failures. Keep up the good work!
Great review. These quality problems are so annoying. Imagine if you actually were in an accident and the airbags didn’t deploy.
"I agree with your thoughts on purchasing vs. leasing. For me, I buy my vehicles for cash and then drive them until the wheels fall off. Leases tend to be an endless hamster wheel of payments. But to each their own."
"Since my recent retirement, I have been considering getting an electric vehicle and your review is exactly what I needed to hear. If it werent for innovators like Elon Musk, many of the conveniences that we take for granted today would have never happened. Frankly, I believe he is on the right track. That said, I own a conventional internal combustion sports car that is a couple of decades old. Like the Tesla, it has just about every bell & whistle that was was technologically available at the time. It has 4-wheel drive and 4-wheel steering, pushbutton suspension stiffening, turbo charging, and a multitude of other innovations that were a novelty at the time of its construction. Along with the state-of-the-art technology came state-of-the-art headaches. In hindsight, I should have opted for reliability over gadgets. While I feel that reliability will come to the innovations found at Tesla, as well as other, electric automobiles it may take longer than Im willing to wait. Now that Im retired Im looking for reliability. Im not willing to chance the possibility of going without A/C on 80 degree days, nor being stranded roadside in my innovative and expensive test platform. In closing, I greatly appreciate your review."
"Omg this is a lovely review of the car! You were so honest and open minded about your opinions. So simple. And the way the video was made, totally loved it. Hope you get your car back in normal condition. And Tesla and every car makers need to prioritise quality and customers safety over market share and profit."
I really appreciate this authentic and thorough review! I am considering a business lease and you and your hubby have helped me with my decision!
"The Porsche Cayenne story got me thinking that the better choice isnt to buy new or lease - its to buy a 4 year old car, at least in the Cayenne category. Thats actually what I did when buying a plug-in hybrid several years ago, and its still running great. I spent so little on it (and paid in cash) that my cost per mile must be quite low, and I can sell it any time without worrying about losing much vs. my purchase price."
"I love your personality you’re so positive and cheerful, as far as the issues for a $100k+ car that is inexcusable…"
Her husband is like an encyclopedia for cars I love talking to guys like that. You can tell he really knows his stuff
Great unbiased and thorough review. You handled your quality issues much better than most.
Great to see an honest real-world review of this Tesla.
Very good review and honest valuation. Im a Tesla fan but really enjoyed your frank and informative review.
I want to own a Tesla. This is the first time Im watching a Tesla review. Your positivity amidst what I would consider a disaster is amazing! Theres a lot of great information about Teslas and car rentals and ownership in general. Im subscribing to your for sure!
"Excellent Review. You handled those two catastrophic events with your car with far more composure than I could have. I think after watching this review, Tesla is a firm NO for me. I need a car to just work day in and day out. Lexus (and Toyota) is the way to go for me for the forseeable future."
Very well done! Any new car buyer would do well to watch this. Concise and to the point. Love it. Ciao!
"A perfectly delightful review, real time (in some places). Exceptional transparency and good reasoning. Well done! I would love to hear how long the AC took to fix, and what happened to the screen blackout. Please leave a link to your current situation."
Who gives af. Wow they make Tesla’s in 4 colors now. Red red blue and white amazing
bro no one cares
Pretty spot on review! Removing the parking sensors is plain stupid although I do not miss the pinball sounds while going through a drive thru. Those get super annoying as the sensors were always way too sensitive on my Model 3. They also seemed to be part of the problem with phantom braking when I got it. Like a sensor would think something was there when it wasn’t.
"Great summary Ryan, thanks! I have found the same issue with using AP on congested roads.This illustrates one of the obstacles to implementing a fully autonomous vehicles IMO. These systems are adaptive but not predictive. You and I can look at our environment and what’s happening. Our minds can also predict what will happen in the future based on the scene in front of us and our human intuition of how other humans will behave (mind reading). AP systems can only respond to the present situation in the moment. So you will accelerate slowly knowing that the car in front is only able to move a short distance, whereas the AP system will plant the gas pedal and then need to brake hard. FSD zealots vastly underestimate the complexity of driving a car and the power of the human mind to predict future events. Understandable, since as humans we find driving to be a “mindless” activity. We can do it, whilst listening to music or holding a conversation with our passengers. Clever aren’t we?"
"I’m going from a 2004 Civic (which I bought brand new) to a 2023 Model Y. So in comparison, I don’t think I’ll find any fault with it at all."
"I was very surprised by the Tesla in car audio speakers / subwoofer. I enjoy making my own subs and setting up audio equipment so when I listened to it for the first time, I was shocked by how good it was."
"Another great video Ryan. Very informative. I too own a Tesla Model Y Long Range. A feature I use quite often that neither you nor many other Youtubers talk about is the Voice Activation features using the right scroll wheel. I find it quite handy while driving to press the right scroll wheel and tell my Tesla what Id like it to do. I often use it to turn on Heat, A/C, or set inside temperature. I use it often to Play a song I want to hear. You simply push the right scroll wheel and say Play such and such and presto the song you wanted plays. You can tell it to turn on or off the heated seats, the heated steering wheel and so much more. Just a simple matter of saying the correct command once youve pressed the scroll wheel. Correct commands include, Engage or Disengage, Play, Turn on or Turn off, etc. It is especially handy when using your phone while driving. Simply press scroll wheel and say Call such and such and it puts the call through. I notice you still have the plastic hubcaps on your Model Y. Folks should also be aware that there are some great looking wheels under those hubcaps that I for one like much better than the hubcaps. The hubcaps pull right off and Tesla sells little black plastic lug bolt caps and a black Tesla logo center cap that really dresses up the cars appearance IMHO. Of course, by taking off the hubcaps you may lessen your range by 5% but it is totally worth it especially in the Long Range version. Anyway, thought folks should be aware of these features that are rarely, if ever mentioned in these videos."
"Fun tip for the windshield wipers, you can actually use voice command for them. Much easier than using the button and then picking the speed on the screen imo."
"Long range, with base wheels is plenty sporty feeling and you get the added ride comfort. Good choice Ryan!"
"Totally agree with how auto-pilot accelerates so fast and waits until the very last second to brake in stop-and-go traffic. I was so scared that the car would not stop on time, so I ended up tapping on the brake by myself and thus disabled auto-pilot. I wish the car would slow down and stop more gradually."
"Spot on, Ryan. Great work with all the Tesla educational videos recently. A nice service to prospective EV buyers out there."
"I also have the same Model Y 2022 LR, but I got the induction wheels, hoping for a little more ground clearance. Like you, I have had 2 surprising phantom braking issues, the first one was a WTF moment. After that, I was ready for it. I agree that my most wanted feature would be Autopilot lane changes, but a 360 degree overhead camera view would also be really helpful. That low rumble is apparent, but not too bothering, no rattles so far. In stop and go traffic, autopilot does not pace as smoothly as I like. The zooming when traffic clears ahead is one problem, but I find it allows a little too much room for cars ahead of me and this almost begs other people to cut in front of me in stop and go traffic. A little of that is fine, but when I want, not all of the time, so I like to close up the following distance at 10 or 15 mph."
"Yes, overhead view should be available via software update. Would also like to see the following (large font mode for those of us that need reading glasses, ability to drag route to a different road/route, fix android text ... many times I get a text and Tesla thinks its an old text from years ago)."
Super happy with my Y LR. But I totally agree on the windshield wiper. Super annoying. Must be buried really deep somewhere in the product backlog. Especially since since the manual override button use would be perfect for capturing an image for training
"I can kind of agree the cooling seats would be a great feature with a car this price, but at the same token are you able to turn on the car from wherever it is you find yourself in so that the interior cabin cools down? I guess I’m asking would that help cool down the seats as well?"
"You should try keeping a large comforter in the lower compartment of the trunk, it’ll help absorb some of that low rumble sound you’re hearing. Try it out."
"The grab handles were not removed for esthetics. They were removed for side airbags. Also, some people have fixed the rumble/boomyness by beefing up the rear hatch seal with 3/8"" vinyl tubing. I havent tried it because I dont have this problem in my 2021 Model Y."
"Great Video Ryan, my Chinese SRMY appears to be well built, no rattles or other issues after 5k km. I have a minor annoyance that the indicators wont go directly from R to L without an intermediate cancel. This would be very useful for roundabouts. We have a lot of them in Australia. How do you get on with the white fascia reflecting in the door mirrors?"
"A crisp, detailed and super useful review. Keep up the good work man"
"Awesome review. Id really like to order one, but without the USS and functioning VISION, its a 100% no go. Very frustrating how they fucked this up so badly."
"Excellent review! I would add to my “wish list” Apple Carplay, so much easier and convenient to have all my podcasts, music, contacts, etc. right there exactly as it is on my iPhone. I am on the fence for an EV mainly due to the added costs of a home charger. I know it’s only $450 or so, but that does not include the costs of an electrician to come out, making sure we have enough amps coming in to our home, adding a 60 amp circuit, etc. etc… Also, still the angst that may come in during a long drive. But thank you for commenting that you have gone on long drives without an issue and finding working Tesla Suoerchargers. This of course the main issue with other makes, that is relying on Chargepoint chargers not working, etc. In fact Marques Brownlee just posted a video on the issues with charging outside your home on his “Auto Focus” YT channel (he has a Tesla S Plaid). All this is tempting but I am still way on the fence. And I don’t want our Gov Newsom or anyone else forcing us to get EVs within 10 years, especially while not addressing the charging issues."
"I agree with how the auto-pilot accelerates too fast at times and waits too long to brake in stop-and-go traffic. I took control a bunch of times. I find the car in the previous update stayed in the lane better, now if is either Right or Left and then back to the middle. Not by much, but usually just the opposite of what I would do. Left turns to seem better than right. Also, a little scary when it stops and then thinks it should turn in front of oncoming traffic (left turn). I find that EAP on the highway is better than FSD, it stays in the HOV lane and changes lanes quicker when I signal. FSD is still cool, but glad I didnt buy and can rent it by the month, think Feb is my last month for a while. 360 view would be great. Agree he shouldnt have killed USS until Vision worked. Phantom Braking isnt too bad, just weird that sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesnt in the same place. Does anyone else with FSD notice that it changes lanes in the intersection, how could they miss that is illegal? Although I can get items from my phone, XM, etc. I would like to see the app store. I like how quiet the car is and I find the ride smooth. The touch screen is quick and works great. So far the AC works well, but we are not at S FL summer yet. I agree cooling seating would be nice. I find the front dual pane windows great and the back single pane sound like could break when you close the doors. Sentry mode is great just in case. Lots of room in the car."
Tesla’s are like no other car. To have one of these would be a dream come true
Im manifesting this car in my possession
This car is the definition of elegant and classy while still being wild
I think the feature that I have a passion for is them falcon wing doors. They just look sooo coool
Great review! I am obsessed and been watching way too many reviews on Mode X. Currently have a Model 3 but working hard to own the X in the future
This is my dream car️
Just bought this car yesterday. In LOVE.
This review was great! Nice and simple with a beautiful car crossing Miamis gorgeous Biscayne bay! What a car indeed!
"Seen one of these on the Street the other night and when they say takes off in 2.7 seconds they mean 2.7 seconds! this car had so much torque and traction, did I mention it was so Quiet(almost stealth like) the way it handles is unreal you got to check this car out I didnt even get a chance to get inside it or or see it from the inside but I saw it at a stoplight and it was beautiful!!!!"
"I saw one up close and it’s got cameras that show the owner if anyones nearby, it has a mode that you can turn on and drives on its own (autopilot sort off) and the owner can turn it on from his cellphone and other stuff. It’s basically a giant toy"
"A friend of mine has one. It is a sweet ride. When they get 500 miles on a charge, I will see about owning one."
This might be one of the coolest cars i have ever seen
"I dont know why most people nowadays arent able to wrap their heads around the awesomeness of what Tesla is bringing to the table with the ""S3XY""!!!! I mean these Model X are flat out phenomenal cars yes there are some flaws here and there but overall these Teslas are magical besides thats usually what youll get when swimming in uncharted territories because clearly Tesla has pushed the envelope over here..."
I will own this car one day speaking it into existence
The only gripe I have about this is the tiny tires. They shouldve put 285s in the back and 255s up front.
I saw 2 of them today. It was so awesome!
0-60 in 2.7 seconds is not insane.... Its ludicrous.
"Love the Tesla model X, & everything about it down to the key fob. Hoping I win."
"My uncle has one of these, and I rode in it! It is so amazing!!!"
I rented one for my wedding. Best car I’ve ever driven by a mile
"I cannot wait until Tesla comes out with a full self-driving car that is fully like the model 2. But I think an instructor would teach me how to drive that. And besides that, if they come out with one that has voice command? Ill take it!"
Great video. Can you please keep us posted on any updates as to Teslas/Elons intensions of producing a residential HVAC system?
Thanks for ALL the info - GREAT PRODUCTION - the style is snappy - keeps you focused - and OF COURSE is a great AD fot Tesla - which is fantastic - We owe ALOT to Elon and the string of things he has started (that does not mean I endorse 100%) but of anyone current alive and what I see as his his qualities - he does get my endorsement
You go Elon! The sky’s the limit! We wait with baited breath for your next invention
Right now Elon musk can do everything technology and bring new models ev to the world respect to you Mr musk.
Exciting lineup...pretty sure the semi out of my price range...still happy to note all new model variety...n the phone I really look 4ward 2...just hope Im still around to enjoy it in the canadian rockies eh!?!!
I wonder if Elon musk would ever attempt to build that health bay from Alyssium.
his technology is unstoppable
"Model 2 hatchback will either cause a new wave of gen Z people buying them, or the model 2 turning into the model 3 with its price going up to the point where it’s not as affordable as intended"
I preordered 2 of them damn it they better have it on file
"We havent been hearing about the pi Phone the last two years, but earlier teasers made it seem like the iPhone killer, a smarter, more capable and versatile personal assistant. Hoping it materializes this millenium."
The future for Tesla gadgets is more bright for their customers users all over the world.
"It is exciting times but, Im looking forward to the new hatchback and the phone...!"
"Interesting , the Pi phone would connect to Starlink? Nice video. With the introduction of vans can E/RVs be far behind? Happy Trails!"
I will be buying this phone the second it comes out
"A mobile with easy Starlink connection, could really change my nowadays preferences"
An idea to lower the price of the cars could be to have less batteries and the option to add more batteries in the future... That smartphone idea seems like a future moneymaker. A Tesla phone or a Space X phone?
Im outdoors alot and a cellphone in the forest is something I thought we wouldnt get for years
Mentioning the unveiling of the cyber truck without speaking about the unforgettable breaking of the windows
"This is amazing, thinking to change my car to tesla"
It would be great if you could do a comparative test with the 4 Tesla vehicles. It would be a good video!
"Excellent comparison between two models of great interest today for performance, load capacity and versatility. Seeing both cars, I was surprised by the superiority of the Model Y in dynamic behavior in curves, which makes it very balanced. Very good observation! Congratulations on your impeccable work, didactic, entertaining and professional. Motor journalism in capital letters, my reference channel for years."
"I loved the report, good job guys"
"I love these everyday videos detailing user experiences. The simile with Apple/Android is completely correct, although it raises controversy."
A comparison and a job of 10. Another important point where Tesla also surpasses many competitors is its way of updating the software continuously and via OTA. Updates that not only improve the multimedia part but also the performance and development of the vehicle.
"Congratulations on the video in general and for getting ""wet"" with the final analogy !! It is a success that you have chosen a route outside the radio stations...in other channels when talking about electric it seems that all of us Spaniards only travel between Madrid-Barcelona-Valencia."
Excellent comparison and great video keep it up greetings from Ecuador
"As always the best communicator, I love your explanations."
"Very good comparison, congratulations Joan! The comparison with smartphones... Perfect!! If I could buy one of the two, the Mustang! (matter of principles) Although I trust that in a few years the problem of superchargers will be fixed!"
"Good similarity with the example of the phones, sums it up very well!!"
"Very good comparison, congratulations! A question regarding the dynamic behavior: How much better is a model 3 to the model Y? Theoretically, with less weight and a lower center of gravity, it should be a benchmark in this regard when its ""brother"" SUV is at such a good level. However, I have heard of the model 3 that it behaves well in general, but I dont remember that anyone qualified it as a benchmark. Is there something else between model 3 and model Y that Im not understanding?"
What a good test you have marked Joan. Im taking the Mustang Mach-e without hesitation.
"Hats off to this test. It gives the feeling that it is the first time that you enjoy an electric car. I am a fan of electric cars and Tesla in particular, for me it is very meritorious that they have been making cars like this since 2012. Sporty, and with a fairly low consumption. Great test you are the best"
Very good comparison and above all useful and clarifying. Thank you
"Whats up, Joan... I am your number one fan, I consider you the best car tester in the world, I would love to know what car you use daily, and what was your first car as a tester. Thank you"
"This guy was born to make comparisons, very, very good"
Congratulations girls. You did great. What an acceleration in the Tesla. It hurts that it is not suitable for all budgets
Excellent I liked the performance of Tesla ... great video
"Very good and concise comparison, Joan. By design I would stay with the Mustang, but due to the practicality of the superchargers and because it brings practically everything imaginable, my decision leans towards the Tesla."
"Very good video, as always you work on comparisons a lot. Your opinion is very valid because you already have many cars behind you."
Sounds like you didn’t like the car before you even bought said car.
"Nope I love it, even the pick up experience I had when I purchased it. Sounds like it’s just not for you. What I love about it…. 1. Seats that just hug you so comfy 2. Handling and the instant torque.. so much fun 3. Green light alerts 4. Car profile linked to me 5. No car keys, just get in and go 6. No car keys, park and get out 7. No locking or unlocking car for its automatic 8. Locking glove box 9. Massive amounts of storage. 10. Moon roof 11. Climate hold to keep the AC/Heat on 12. Tesla Charging network, no credit cards or payment machine 13. Mobile phone app and it’s array of features 14. etc……."
I like how I can leave it running in the garage with the door closed and it doesnt kill my family
Sounds like Tesla wasn’t the brand for you. What made you buy it? Did you test drive one before purchasing?
"Yeah, sounds like you’re on the mindset of having a bunch of buttons, clickity clack type car. As with any car, you have to get used to any interface except in this car, the interface is everything. Similarly, took a lot of people some time to get used to an iPhone touch screen coming from a blackberry with a full out physical keyboard"
Lmao what did I just read.
"Curious, what car did you or your family drive before the Y?"
You can use voice commands for most daily functions like “navigate home” “I’m hot” “I’m cold” “open trunk”.
Floor it. Then you’ll like it. 😅
OP has no response since initial post. Just a trigger post.
You didnt like the buying experience? So you just miss the pagentry and pomp of being ground down by a slimy sales guy only to be abused and ripped off by the finance guy?
If you thought the high price meant luxury that is where you went wrong. You’re not paying the luxury price for a luxury vehicle. You’re paying for the features and charging network which is leaps and bounds better than the competitors that’s about it.
I love my 2022 performance Model Y. I had a Chevy Volt before. Even more after adding apple CarPlay in to center console screen & adding center usb-c which support data (music/game controllers) & power. Tesla should not have removed data ability in center console leaving only a data capable port in glovebox which is used by teslaCam.
Looks like you are in the minority. Sell it and make someone else happy
How old are you? Your reaction is spot on for someone rapidly losing neuro-elasticity
"Thats a bummer. Maybe itll grow on you. There will definitely be a lot of snarky comments, but sounds like its just not the car for you. Have you ever ""loved"" a car? I find that the process of picking gets you more emotionally invested in the inaminate object. The car buying process is hands-down the best when compared to traditional auto dealers. You dont have to sit through all the BS."
"I’m not sure what your expectations were, but it sounds like the car didn’t meet them. Is the car perfect? Definitely not, but in reality no car is. It may not be the right car for you or your family. Convenience and simplicity is a huge reason why many like it. No keys needed, no gas station to stop at, no oil changes, and does the job well. I enjoy the lack of engine noise and can sit in my car comfortably when in a parking spot."
"No need to convince you otherwise. I love the car. If you don’t, sorry you wasted your time and money. Hopefully you’ll be able to test out your next future purchase"
Tesla’s aren’t for everyone. Sorry to hear about your experience. I would recommend always doing your research and test driving any potential new car.
Sell it then
"Um… did you buy it blindly? Like, did you even go to a gallery to experience it in person before buying it? If not…. Don’t know what to tell you lol"
"I love my MY. Except for the stupid elimination of parking sensors. A Tesla is the car equivalent of a smartphone. You get a high tech car. If thats what you enjoy, then you will be happy. If you are looking for legacy car luxury, then it will be a poor fit for you. But Im surprised that you figured that out after spending $70k. Did you test drive before buying?"
"I loved my wife’s model Y so much when she picked it up in January, that I put an order for another in February. Now we don’t need to share lol. Hopefully you all can sell it or learn to like it."
From my experience the 3/Ys are not luxury cars. The S/X are more along those lines but also debatable. When the Model 3 was 40k it aligned well. Now the 3/Ys are so expensive. The price does not align with the features and luxury feel you can get from other cars at the same or cheaper price point.
"> The interface to do anything is kind of a pain in the neck. Agreed. I would prefer physical, tactile buttons for commonly used functions &#x200B; >In the meantime, it does stupid things like a fart machine and a light show. I suppose it has to do something to keep you engaged with it. ??? Ive never seen any of that &#x200B; >Something about it feels utilitarian I LOVE utilitarian! I refer to it as my Transportation Utensil. I dont want to be ""engaged"" with my transportation utensil, I want it to be a reliable and useful tool"
"The car might not be for people who are adverse to change. I’m anIT guy who loves just about anything that plugs in or runs on batteries, so I absolutely love it. But for people that are not into change or bleeding edge tech, it probably is somewhat of a let down."
"My MYLR is a company car. There’s a lot I miss about my BMW 530e that I’ve had for 4 years but I fundamentally wanted a family full EV with loads of storage and range. There wasn’t much choice in the company car catalogue for full EVs. Had an iX or e-tron been available I think it would have been a more difficult decision. Things I miss about the 530e: - More comfortable suspension (despite feeling sporty and controlled in bends, it was a sublime ride compared to ‘23 model Y). - Despite having an internal combustion engine, the BMW was much quieter in the cabin at speed on the motorways than the Tesla. - More comfortable seats (I think they were just bigger and plushy leather) - Leather everywhere - Wider inside (BMW was very wide, lots of shoulder space in the back even with a child car seat). - Parking sensors (don’t get me started) - Apple CarPlay (Apple Music on Tesla at least offers some consolation) - Could use cheap roof bar system from Halfords (Tesla roof bar is £450!!!!) - Speed limit recognition is better on the BMW especially on the British “Smart Motorways”. However things which are great on the Tesla: - Full EV, goodbye weekly £60 petrol tank refill. - Tesla Autopilot is far superior to BMW Driving Assistant Plus - SuperCharger network (probably the main reason I chose Tesla over any other EV) - in 4 years, not a single OTA update on the BMW especially to fix some CarPlay issues and Autopilot issues. In contrast I got a Tesla OTA update within 2 weeks of ownership. Let’s face it cars are gadgets as much as your phone is these days. The expectation is that gadgets get software updates and they get better and more features as time goes on. Tesla knows this. BMW does not. - Tesla at least considers RHD countries in its touch screen UI. BMW clearly forgot that some countries have the driver on the right. - Heated everything I.e. steering wheel and back seats (expensive options on the BMW) - Cameras everywhere (expensive option on the BMW) - Loads of storage (despite the lack of shoulder space in the back) - Flat rear foot well (no rear drive shaft/transmission tunnel) - Tow bar (was not even an option on the 530e) - kids love the glass roof - Keyless entry/phone key (expensive option on the BMW) - The touch screen on the Tesla is at least within arms reach. I don’t know who designed the BMW touch screen to be so far away from the driver but it was a stupid decision."
"Best car purchase Ive ever had! Didnt have to talk to a single person. Car was delivered to my driveway. Marked as delivered after the driver was already in the Uber on the way back to the lot. No small talk, no over anxious salesperson pushing the sale. I wouldnt wish a dealership experience on my worst enemy."
Probably the husband is making her hate the car; so that she won’t take the car from him.
"It looks like you wanted a luxury vehicle with best in class battery charging experience and infrastructure. Luxury vehicle it ain’t, but it sure has a vastly superior infrastructure and charging capabilities vs its competitors."
"Its a appliance/family compact SUV. I dont see why it would be very exciting, apart from straight line acceleration of course. The steering is quick and accurate but lack any response to grip level changes when driving hard, just like most modern appliance cars. It is however one of the least SUV driving SUVs out there. Mine is my typical daily driver, Mon -Fri only, not touching it on the weekends. (This may very well change with track mode now) I do love the buying and delivery experience though, because I hate dealers with a passion."
What car did you come from? Sounds like you want a BMW or Porsche
Seems like OP is underwhelmed and disengaged in her own thread…also no back story or deeper insights on why for comparison— just a blatant lazy rant.
I came from a Volvo and the interior is a little bit of a let down in comparison and less comfortable to drive but I absolutely love the car! Exceeded my expectations in most areas. The technology is amazing and keeps improving.
Sell it !
I like the car but customer service is by far the worst experience I’ve had. And how do you complain about the autopilot that is the best thing for me for my long commute
">It just feels like transportation. This is part of what makes driving any Tesla wonderful in a metropolitan or urban environment, or places with lots of highway traffic. Its absolutely not designed to be an exciting car. Its almost by definition a pretty boring car. It does have everything I need, tons of space (front trunk, rear trunk, sub trunk, side trunks, rear seat fold down, deep center console storage, aftermarket storage bins that slide under the seats) and *absolutely* nothing you dont need. Super minimal by design, for both manufacturing and the ""vibe"". I like to call it my refrigerator on wheels, as it really is a lot more like an appliance than a conventional car. &#x200B; The boring point A-point B of the thing makes it absolutely wonderful for monotonous drives through traffic. Stick it on autopilot, put some music on, and chill. &#x200B; Sounds like you bought the wrong car overall. I also dont blame you being underwhelmed at the current price point mainly on features and overall quality, but the driving experience really is sublime in the right environment. &#x200B; If you live somewhere where there is zero traffic, zero traffic through long stretches or red lights and stop signs, etc, then yeah its going to be a very unrewarding drive."
"I feel the exact opposite. The best car I’ve ever owned. I’m impressed by the little things I find every day. I find excuses to drive and drive far. Two weeks away from owning the car for two months and I’m approaching 4000 miles. I’ll crave something and just drive hundreds of miles to go eat it. I had to help my daughter put her car into the garage while she was away. Even driving up the driveway, I felt utterly disappointed in driving a gas vehicle again. Is it the EV part you don’t like or the minimalism?"
"I agree with most of your points. Something about dishing out a large amount of money without getting the ""I feel good"" feeling. My wife had the same experience. She was expecting a quieter ride, higher quality part feel, etc... However, a month after learning all the benefits of the car, she would not allow us to purchase any other car than a Tesla. Shes dead set on the Cyber Truck if it ever comes out. My only advice is to give it some time and by time I mean weeks or even months for all the bells and whistles baked into the software to take full effect. As updates roll out, youll start seeing the benefit of buying a car from a software company."
"I have had a Y since mid 2021 and an X Plaid since mid 2022. The X definitely has more of a fancy car feel than the Y. (Though at double the price, it’s still overpriced.). Even just having the little screen in front of the driver makes it feel less like a toy car and a Disney ride. The Y is a great commuter car. It has great safety features. Basic AutoPilot is excellent. The interior is undoubtedly spartan and utilitarian. No doubt. I also find that it lacks buttons for things better done with buttons. I usually engage AutoPilot as a safety measure when toying with the screen to do simple things that in the history of cars have been done better with buttons. You will find little sympathy on this reddit thread. Most people who drive the Y have never experienced acceleration like an EV can provide. That runs over many other considerations all by itself. The passenger experience is ho-hum at best for a car that now typically runs near $70K. Please don’t get a third row in this thing, it’s a joke and a children’s deathtrap. A lot of things do feel cheap and easily damaged. The plastic trim around the seats easily breaks off a little plastic nub that holds it on and then it hangs loose… this happens so easily and often people know the solution is just to thread a wire-tie through as a replacement. Wiper fluid and rain have no channel or bump to guide slop away and god forbid you have the driver window open even a crack, you’ll get soaked. No other vehicle I own has this concern. Anyway… I have enjoyed the Y, but I have money to burn and didn’t want to refuel a gas car every other day when commuting. Being able to plug in (level2) at home is great. I look forward to competition taking away Tesla’s ability to “remove” any more features, making these cars even more utilitarian. Already new 3/Y models are losing ultrasonic sensors. It’s ridiculous. They lost radar before I got mine, but USS loss is so much worse. Any cheapo car will have USS but your new $70K EV won’t. Horrible. Anywho…"
You should’ve convinced your husband not buy it which is not a possible with Tesla 🦾
"some of y’alls feelings are for real hurt! lol. OP, mission accomplished"
"Its a car with really bright highlights (instant acceleration, phone key, remote access/schedule) and very obvious flaws (stupid auto wipers, cabin noise, subpar build quality). I got screen freeze, tailgate leak, door alignment issues in the first 1k miles. I like it because the highlights are more important to me. But its not for everyone. What sucks is that there is so little real competition in US therefore Tesla can very much do whatever it wants without consequence (price increase over time, low build quality, bad service experience, etc.)."
"You aren’t the right person for the car. If you are disappointed in simple interiors like it sounds like you are (cheap, utilitarian) then Tesla is the last car you should’ve bought. I have an Audi who make arguably the best interiors in their class. Love the car but they can’t compete with Tesla on OTAs, acceleration, or simply being electric with range and a good charging network. To me all of that vastly outweighs the quality of the interior. I have three dogs as well so the interior is much more durable for that type of abuse. If Tesla made a premium interior I would take it as long as it didn’t include real leather. But they don’t and it still remains the best option for me."
Just think of the shoes you can buy with the fuel savings.
Have you considered speaking to the manager?
"Replace MY with ""Elon"" and you sound like all his exs."
"Its poorly made by poorly paid non-union labour. As soon as the Detroit automakers ramp up EV production, its game over for Tesla & Elon."
What are you telling us for?
I bet you’re fun at parties
Sorry youre not feeling it. I definitely love my 23 MYP. Had it for a little over a month now and there are some minor annoyances (no car is perfect) but I think the good far outweighs the bad and I look forward to my morning commute more than ever. I live in an area with cold winters and I love how warm and cozy the car is when I get inside. My biggest annoyances are kind of small. for one I dont like the way the wipers work. Auto wipers seem buggy and I wish there were a few levels below level 1. something more intermittent. I think there is a lot of room for improvement there. I also dont like the way Spotify is implemented in the car. The sound quality is not very good and the app seems very stripped down versus the version on my phone. I hope that the car continues to improve via OTA updates. My minor gripes definitely dont take away from the fact that buying gas and getting oil changes are a thing of the past for me with this car.
"If I had anything to complain about the car, I would wish for the suspension to be a little better to smooth out the ride but I get it’s a performance car so tough to believe it’d be that smooth. Other than that, super fun car and impressed by the over the air updates and all of the other perks of driving a Tesla"
I love my 2021 MY. The only thing I do not like is the crazy price hike. Recently saw the 2023 Volvo EX90 and it has all the bells and whistles I wish the Model Y had for the same price point. Note: The advantage that Tesla has its the supercharging network as of right now there is nothing better. But once the competition like Electrify America and CCS catches up it will be a different story.
I picked up mine last Monday and already put 1k miles on it. I feel the complete opposite. I love it and look forward to driving it. Interesting we feel completely different. I guess depends what you were driving before
I love mine to the moon! No regrets.
How someone could drive this car and not be blown away is beyond me.
I absolutely love my 2022 myp the excitement I had when first picking up was something. Also I look for any opportunity to drive the car.
"Sorry but you sound older, 45+, and out of touch with technology You’re using the interface for the first time, everything has a learning curve… Why buy it if you don’t want to drive it? This honestly sounds like a troll post, you’re not even responding to anyone"
I think a lot of people have such high expectations that they sometimes get let down like yourself. It’s not a luxury car even though it costs like it one. The entire process is streamlined taking away the hunt of finding your new car. Hopefully. You can learn to appreciate it for what it is rather than what you expected it to be.
"Tech in it finally feels like we are somewhere in 21st century. Sold my brand new Toyota RAV4 prime ( costs $50k) because the tech in it was so dated . Autopilot, self-highway driving are the winner for me with the full panoramic glass roof and instant EV torque."
"My wife said the same. During the first two weeks, I was even thinking about selling it as she complained almost every day. Now after two wlmonths, Im barely allowed to drive the car 😀. She is not in love with the car but having preheated car every morning thats easy to drive and its always ready to go (no need to go to the gas station)... But I have to admit I share her biggest complaint - nonexistent rear view. The rear window is too small, the rear camera gets dirty in a few kilometers in this weather and even though we still have USS it doesnt beep as were used to it. Parking is..."
"Reads like a troll account. Saying you test drove a lot of them, still bought it, and now hate it doest sound like something people do."
"Its definitely a car to test drive or maybe even rent. Its very different in a way that some people are going to love and others arent. We rented one and my wife LOVED the interior and loved riding in it. She wants the car more than I do and its more for riding in it than driving it (which is kind of odd, I admit). I liked it way more than I wanted or expected to and I think part of that was how different it was, but again, I can see someone having the exact opposite reaction and Id totally get it. Im sorry its not the car for you, it must be a big bummer to get a hyped car only to be disappointed. Hopefully youll at least grow to like it more, but Im skeptical that youll ever love the car as I think your tastes just dont match what the car is. I have a feeling an ev6 might have been the better choice here for you."
"I went EV shopping today and checked out all the Teslas, and drove a couple. Ive never been in one before, believe it or not. I was not impressed. There is no excuse to have such a low-quality interior. I checked out almost every EV I could find between 50-80k$. I was not impressed with the Y Model. We liked the Mercedes EVs and even the beamer. The range could have been better, though, and the lack of access to charging stations is a bust. We may have to wait for some of these new cars to enter the field this year. With cars like the Fisker Ocean and many others entering the EV field later this year(hopefully) with beautiful interiors and exteriors, advanced technology, and significantly better range, Tesla will have to start trying harder. The look of the car is stale and outdated, in my opinion. I personally lease cars because I like being in new cars with new tech. It feels great driving a beautiful car but to each their own. I spent 8 hours checking out multiple dealerships and even non-EVs. The interior of model Y was on par with low-end trims of sub $35k cars. (outside of the TV in the middle of the car)"
"Dont listen to all the fan boys here, you make a very valid point. It is an excellent car until you step into the cockpit. It feels and looks cheap, reminds me of an Ikea living room."
"Tesla model Y is not a luxury car. With federal and state rebates the base model y AWD is around 42k before tax. Shop around and you cant find an AWD EV with acceleration in the 5s range for 0-60, etc. You will need to pay 10k more. For one who doesnt qualify for the rebates, there are lots of other options and its worth test driving them all: Toyota BZ4X, Mustang Mach E, Ioniq 5, VW id.4"
You husband had the same feeling about the diamond ring :)
"Glad you are happy with the car. I agree that the price is the main issue. Look I don’t expect a perfect car but the price itself does make me tend to look harder for flaws. Speaking of mobile connector, i actually had my order in a few days before the cutoff day for free mobile connectors (April 27 i think). i know, lucky. But when i picked up the car the sales rep flat out refused to give me one when i said my order should have it. Even after i showed him Tesla’s own online store page clearly listing April 27, he was stunned for a few seconds, then proceeded to show me a internal email that says April 17 instead. I insisted that this was your own internal mistakes and asked for manager. The answer i got, which i remember vividly, is “the manager is in a meeting and no one is gonna honor this.” Mind you, this was a Saturday. The funny part is I later submitted a service ticket and got this issue resolved the next day. I still remember the guy’s face when i walked in and picked up my mobile connector. He clearly recognized me. I’m glad it was quickly resolved eventually but the arrogance of that sales team was insane."
"Enjoy, the M3 RWD is basically 90% of all the good features of a Tesla for 60% of the price of the Y."
"Ive had mine for a little over a year. The vehicle drives very well.. love the handling and love the performance (M3 LR - no performance upgrade). Pricing wasnt a big deal to me, especially compared to what dealerships are charging for other vehicles right now. But with the recent price increases, I would think its overpriced at that cost as well. My wife was extremely hesitant to drive the car in the beginning because she couldnt get used to it. She refused to, but when the gas prices skyrocketed, she finally gave in. Now, she loves the car. My ""gripes"" (not necessarily about Tesla, but the complete experience): * Interior ""looks"" a little cheap for the price. Because the car is so simplistic (steering wheel and a screen), it just doesnt have the same look luxury cars with the same price point have. * I think its stupid that you have to pay to unlock upgrades. If the car has the physical capability, why not include it. Hate that cars are going the way of the video game ""DLC"" route. With the LR, Im happy that the only upgrade is the performance boost, but if rear heated seats or premium sound was extra, Id be pretty upset. I refused to get a Toyota because of them doing this for the remote start and a lot of other car manufacturers are doing the same thing. * I am concerned about the life of the battery long term and the cost to eventually replace it. * Repair times - ugh. I have clients that also own Teslas. One of them told me that they were rear-ended by a vehicle owned by a TLC.. he went through his own insurance because dealing with the TLC insurance company is a huge headache, but he doesnt have rental car coverage. Its been 2 months and the car hasnt been fixed yet and hes been without a car this whole time. * Fuckin rims. Roads can be extremely narrow around where I live and theres not a lot of parking. Parallel parking is a necessary skill. And getting as close to the curb as possible is also recommended if you dont want to be hit. I cant believe how many times Ive scratched up the rims. * Driving long distances is a pain for EVs. I went up to Toronto (from NY) last winter and it was extremely nerve wracking between super chargers at times. It originally estimated that Id have 13% battery life remaining between my 2nd and 3rd charge.. I ended up with 1%. Charging also adds a bunch of time to your trip time too. My brother has a Mach E and we took separate cars for another trip to Canada. This time I took my minivan because I went up with my family. He left early in the afternoon from NJ and I left late in the evening from NYC. I ended up arriving at Niagara Falls before him despite him leaving half a day earlier. There were other delays like them stopping for food or stuff like that, but there was no way I should have arrived before them. Wasnt like I was driving extremely fast either because it was foggy out too. Would have loved the ability to use AP on the drive though. * Supercharging is really expensive. If you dont have access to a charger at home (or wherever you park), you probably shouldnt consider an EV. But overall, I love the car and the benefits heavily outweigh the negatives."
Thank you for your honest incite on why you got the M3. I agree with you 💯! I received my M3 last week and I still cannot stop grinning when I look at the car. It’s simply a work of art! 😂
"Oh, I should add one more ""Ugly"". The Lack of USS before a reliable implementation of the camera based version. Im totally fine with them Removing USS if they had a viable alternative solution as I think the car looks a lot better without all those silly circles around the bumpers, but, Im very annoyed that they dont have a viable solution implemented BEFORE removing USS. Its very annoying when parking in a tight garage to not have the USS or some sort of close distance warning. Im fine with the limitations of a vision based system, but have it available and ready BEFORE removing the USS!"
"The odd thing about the chargers is that I ordered both the mobile charger and wall connector at the same time that I ordered my RWD a couple weeks ago. Just got notification that my chargers arrived, which is actually a bit concerning as I’m out of town for Thanksgiving. It’s odd that mine arrived fairly quickly but I’m seeing so many posts about the long wait. Hopefully my car arrives quickly too!"
Thank you for the write up! My questions are: can you kindly give me the aliexpress link for the hubcaps? Any other accessories you have bought for the car?
I tapped out when you said you had a kid and upgraded to white interior.
Why does Tesla constantly struggle to keep connectors in stock? And don’t say “forced scarcity”.
When is HW4 going into M3 and MY’s?
The quality reminds me of 90s Hyundai
"How are people spending so much on a Tesla and not going onto youtube and searching ""reasons not to buy a Tesla"". I mean, this applies to any large purchase. Theres really no excuse to be surprised by anything nowadays given someone has done a video articulating the pros and cons of every product on the planet."
"Maybe focus on the other advantages— instant acceleration and power, never having to go to the gas station. Extreme simplicity. One pedal driving. I love tacc/lane keep (but other cars have this too)."
"Drive it for a few weeks. Then drive a different car. Unlikely you will ever go back to an ICE car. You may go on to another EV, if you find one. Nothing wrong with that. You have all three cameras up for backing up, yes? And you back into spots, and forward out into traffic. And wait for your first U-turn. That will be a great disappointment :-)"
Ive got 50k miles on mine. No complaints on maps or navigation. No Bluetooth issues either. Rear cross traffic alerts is a big miss in this price point and should be there. Ive got fsd so no issues with lane changes and having to reingage autopilot. Ultimately if your nalot happy sell it. Id give it some time first. Ive test driven many other cars and they all feel like a step backwards compared to the tesla. Faults and all.
"Im delighted with my 3, but sell yours if youre not happy with it."
I sympathize with you OP. Teslas technological prowess has slowed way down in the past year. Youre not wrong to feel disappointed. Paying $200/mo for auto lane change is an added joke.
I agree with you. Rear traffic alert needs to be more useful.
Sounds like you should just sell it and drive your work vehicle.
"I don’t know how long you have driven it, but I’d wait a month to see if you feel differently about it. I enjoyed mine, but I sold it. I still own a Model S. Try enhanced autopilot for a month, and you might feel it’s a worthwhile upgrade. I have had rear cross traffic alert on two cars, and it’s invaluable. I also prefer blind-spot mirrors over Tesla’s approach."
"I think you mean autopilot which has to be reactivated. Tesla’s Lane Assist is the same as the Ford lane keep. It’s turned on under the autopilot menu and stays on all the time. With Lane Assist, if you cross over the line, it will gently nudge you back. You don’t have to activate it like auto steer. Ford’s version of Autopilot is called Blue Cruise. I also have a Ford with lane keep and it’s not comparable to Autopilot with auto steer. They are different things."
"For Autopilot (lane keep), what you’re talking about is a difference in mindset. Tesla views AP, like FSD, as an all-or-nothing thing: either the car is driving itself, or you are. If you intervene, you’ve taken over, and the auto feature is now off. It *would* be nice if they had a mode where it could be blended, where it could automatically keep trying to center itself in whatever lane you’re in, even after you change lanes manually. But I can also see that that increases the software complexity quite a bit, and might also make the user interface more “fuzzy,” where it could be more likely that the car could do something you don’t expect, if you forget that it’s still in that semi-automatic mode. Having autosteer break off when you turn the wheel is a “clean” interface, and a lot of people prefer it that way. But mostly, I suspect, it seems like the company is pouring all its resources and talent into pursuing FSD, and doesn’t want to get bogged down validating and supporting major auto-drive features that aren’t directly on the path to FSD. Personally, I have the FSD package (and EAP before that), so I may not be experiencing the same thing as OP, since I can have AP do lane changes for me. But I only actually use that less than half the; usually I don’t trust it to do the lane change well enough when the situation is too dynamic; it’s usually too timid, even though it’s a lot better than it used to be. So I break it off, and only re-engage when I’m settled into the new lane. The double-flick of the stalk is trivially easy to do. What I do really wish they’d fix is how AP tends to “slop” to the outside of every turn, as if it only realizes at the last second that the road is curving. If there’s a car in the next lane, that means I get uncomfortably close to them, and I often just take over if it’s a tight turn. It *is* pretty annoying that they haven’t addressed this issue even slightly in my 4 years of ownership so far."
"I agree with pretty much everything you said I traded in my Tesla for a Mach-E and Im happier with everything except Fords one pedal driving its not near as smooth as Teslas. I prefer Fords Lane centering to Tesla autopilot to. Its difficult to describe but I kind of like how its more passive instead of active if that makes sense. Another thing Tesla does better is the phone as a key, but with recent updates the Fords getting a little better at that."
Yeah. Somehow its hyped up to a level that is unreal. Good car . Not as groundbreaking as its made out to be.
Sell. Get something else and avoid the service pain. If your not in love the first service call will drive you over the Edge. So get out quick and move on
Have to agree. I really like the car but it misses a lot of features you would expect at that price. Not really sure how long they think they can keep stuff like this up
">I didn’t realize that lane keep assist would go off and disengage if you cross over a line to avoid a pothole or trashcan or anything else without signaling. This is incredibly stupid in my opinion and something, that again, my work vehicle handles like a pro. What does your Explorer do if you manually steer it into another lane with full lane keeping assist on? If you steer the car when it is in lane keeping autopilot then the car thinks you have taken over, so it disengages. You then need to tell the car to engage again once you are past whatever happened. [ It sounds like you didnt read much about how the Tesla works before you got your car. Your complaints dont quite make sense, did you not know Apple Play wasnt an option? The navigation is its own app so you do have to figure out how it works, but I tend to just hit the mic and say ""Navigate me to <location or thing, such as coffee>."
"What issues are you having with navigation/maps? Maybe there’s something we can suggest here that can help, but we’ll need more info on what’s going wrong. Aside from that, yeah there a lot of growing pains with Tesla right now which are nearly all software related. Good news is that should change beforehand years end. The ultrasonic sensor removal was dumb, but their vision based solution for it has already been rolled out in software version 2022.40.1. That should help with backing up a bit. Next month (probably around Christmas) Tesla will be doing their yearly holiday update which will likely merge production software with FSD beta. That means Autopilot, which currently makes a lot of mistakes, will be using the brains that FSD beta is powered by along with the [updated visualization]( This should make Autopilot a lot smoother while giving you more confidence in what it’s doing since you’ll have a much better picture of what it’s seeing. As for lane keep going off when you cross the lines, that can be disabled. It was added in a software update after a person fell asleep at the wheel, crossed the center line in a two-way tunnel, and died after getting in a head on collision. Since learning that I just keep it in as I’d minor deal with the minor annoyance of it going off erroneously sometimes as opposed to not having it go off at all. That’s your call though. Also, for what it’s worth, Tesla isn’t perfect. No car is. A friend of mine has a Q4 e-tron and while it certainly is much nicer inside and far better built, he still has many complaints with it. His range is really poor, especially in winter where he gets like 170-180 miles on a charge (became an issue during our last ski trip… his car fell way short on range and we had to go out of our way to find a charger while my car still had ~70 miles left after driving at the same speed as him). That was his first road trip and let me tell you, he wasn’t happy. In fact, he actually said he wanted to trade it in for a Tesla after that. Grass isn’t always greener on the other side."
"You should see some other EV infotainment. Is Tesla’s perfect? No. Are they top 3 in the industry. Yes. I also will bet good money that if those little things big you this much, you are going to be extremely disappointed with the competition. But do your diligence and try out others before making a massive decision like you are contemplating."
"I know what you mean. I feel Ike there was an incredible pace of exciting new features for the first years of the Model 3. Now since 2020 it feels like the experience is going backwards. The last 2 major updates were huge mistakes and took the whole year to make functional again. I dread the end of this year, they will probably fuck everything up again. 🍾 I didn’t notice that with the sensors, just did an update this week so I’ll have to check it out."
I view mine as a commuter appliance. It’s not special.
"Ive never had to re-engage lane keep/auto steer on changing lanes. If you have auto steer/auto nav turned on, it will change lanes for you. If you manually take control and move the steering wheel too much while it is auto Navigating, it (correctly, imo) returns full control to you. Hitting the brakes turns off both navigation and auto steering."
That’s a shame. I’ve had none of those issues. I just bought another Tesla.
"It just depends on what you expect out of the car. If these are basic things you expect out of a car, there’s nothing wrong with that. To each their own. But I would not expect Tesla to add or improve these anytime soon."
"Its a car from last decade, so ..."
"Most of those issues will probably be fixed in time through software updates, that is if you dont mind waiting."
"You don’t have fsd or eap. With eap you will just signal for lane change and it will do on its own. However if you take over, you have to re engage it yourself"
"I Love My 2022MYLR, only 3000 miles on it each ride is better than the last. Every time I get in my car I feel like Im stepping into the future."
I think you hyped yourself and did a lot of reading online Just drive the car for a bit and see how you feel Just about anything that gets over hyped is disappointing
"yeah totally agree, Tesla has an impressive marketing machinery, making it look like the most advanced car ever. For me it feels like this incredible marketing makes the car disappoint when you actually drive one. The best I have found so far, is autosteer on the highways, which really works incredibly well. And thats it, that is all the technology that I got out of a 70k car \^\^ My 8 year old Golf has better ACC (no phantom braking, no annoying beeping without any real threats etc), better parking sensors, does actually park automatically, has a back window you can actually look out of etc. Its a shame really, they have the right visions, they just dont deliver on them. And yes, less sensors is not a good thing, I dont care what the vision people talk about"
When I change lanes and a car is in my blind spot all I get is a red car and red lane markings. I never hear a beep or anything. Is this normal? I never hear rear cross traffic either. I have a May 22 build with sensors.
I was disenchanted when I first got my Y too. I love my car now. It may need tweeted. About the blue tooth file a bug report w a time stamp. Call Tesla in Freemont CA. Customer service is great. Not sure if you tried rebooting? And about the lane assist put your turn signals on. Good luck. Oh yes the GPS sucks. This needs help big time. Need to ask did you get FSD? My 2020 was FSD and I got hit hard at a red light.(car should have been totaled) but traded for 2022 without FSD. ….. I couldn’t use it here. No one drives the speed limit. Good luck.
"Sounds like you should trade it in on an Explorer. It does things differently than what youre used to. If you dont like that, thats fine. Its not for everyone."
I love mine every day. I’m spoiled for every other car now.
"1) half the “missing” features are because you didn’t purchase EAP. 2) there’s giant cameras video feeds on the screen. Use that to look for a rabbit. 3) try other devices for Bluetooth. I’ve never had an issue with any of my devices. If it persists Ike a. Ticket for repair. 4) I find it odd that you were “so hyped” yet don’t know basics about the car. Regardless of what you do with the car, you should talk to a professional about the impulsivity you’ve displayed. And yes. Overly critical due to not being informed."
"FINALLY! Thank you for an honest post. It really isn’t worth it. A “close relative” of mine bought one and all I do is Google crap they call me about because they don’t know how to use it. In the future these cars probably won’t have windows, steering wheels, displays. Just 4 seats and a door. LOL"
"Just got mine. So far not very impressed with FSD, maybe I need to study it more but so far I am not sure what it does. To me FSD is when I get into my car and say ""Hey car, drive me to my cousin Alex in Parsippany, NJ."" There was sitting water around the seal in the back of trunk after driving in the rain. Some vibration when driving, I think it is the tires. Then again I am super sensitive to vibration and almost every car that I ever owned always has some vibration at one point. Then again, once I got a new Mercedes, pulled (slightly) at a grab handle above the door and it came off, lol."
"Im doing a 30 day rental of a model 3 to see how I like it. I agree...the camera system isnt state of the art. But just because its got a tesla badge, I guess we cant expect every single thing to be cutting edge. Ive never used self driving before, and ok with it relinquishing control after I avoid a pothol or change lanes. When I take control for any reason, Id be shocked if the car took control back from me without the order. That would get confusing. The GPS is crap. Google based? If so, it missed a few updates along the way. I completely agree this needs a revamp. As for the Bluetooth, for my android phone, its rock solid. Id tell tesla about that. You might need a new Bluetooth router. Otherwise, Im loving the car. If I get a Y, Im hoping it has comfort suspension (its too stiff for me) and dual pane windows to make it more quiet. Good luck with yours! Just stomp on the accelerator whenever yo7 get frustrated....or drive by a gas station charging $6/gallon, ride on your horn and give those icers the finger. Thatll make you smile."
"My husband picked up a 2023 model y the other day. Its... OK. I cant really say I particularly enjoy driving it, and I probably would not buy one myself. There is something very utilitarian, almost a bit cheap looking in the interior about it, and its not very comfortable to drive in. Also, the lack of manual controls is very annoying, and the giant screen is also annoying. I am glad he is enjoying it, but I will probably wait for some other EV that offers a different feeling and a different experience."
"I’ve got a Nissan LEAF and a Tesla Model 3. Both have similar mileage, and neither have given me any issues. I’ve had my tyres replaced at Tesla after the original set wore out and they were entirely painless to deal with. There was also a small reflector that went missing at some point and a mobile ranger came out and replaced it for free. Can’t comment on expense to repair because nothing has broken that needed repairing in over three years and 74,000km of ownership. Neither car has ever left me at the side of the road other than when I got a puncture and had to wait for someone to come and help. I’ve had that happen with ICE cars too so I wouldn’t count that against either EV. Reliability stats put EVs in an entirely different class. Reported reliability for Toyota is 85%, the LEAF is 99% and based on my experience with the Model 3 there’s no difference in reliability yet."
We have a model 3 and an Audi Q4 etron. Only have had the etron about 2 weeks so not a ton of comparisons yet. Range and charging ease is better on the model 3. Comfort and build quality is better in the Audi. There is significant road noise in the model 3 which you don’t get in the Audi. Sound system is better in the Tesla along with using the cars app.
"2018 Model 3 RWD: good car and I was so happy with it I got a 2022 Model Y as the second car. Had a few minor issues with the Model 3, never been stranded though. Service has been great and one of the reasons I got a second Tesla but that depends on your area. Part catalog is online and heard mixed reports on parts, even the same part (like the fender) some get no problem while others say they wont sell it to them. The few out of warranty repairs have had done seemed fair (internal camera $380, 12v battery $120) and what they would have charged me for the other things werent THAT bad (I think worse was rear window for $800, but it was an early flaw so free). I really like the ~30 buttons around the steering wheel and then things I hardly ever use while driving on the screen. I also like the lack of a display behind the steering wheel at night (wasnt sure when I got it, now that is a plus), but some cars you can turn it off and in the day I dont care. The main thing I dont like is the hip room from the cross support behind the seats when sleeping in the back (I liked to stay at RV to charge). I get used to the acceleration but it is still fun to feel after a long day, to each their own though. I hope to keep it for at least ~11 more years. Supercharger network is great but hopefully they will start adding CCS protocol and adapter so if that is your major reason just be ready if they do and you feel bad. They said end of last year but who knows when, if ever. If you change your mind post purchase in the past Tesla has had good resale value but the car shortage is easing up so dont expect to get full value, but historically it has been good. My other BEV experience is 5 years with a 2013 Leaf (Model Y replaced) and drove a friends Mach-E for ~20 minutes. The Mach-E felt like a larger Leaf, I had to push a button to even start it. Traction control seemed a little slow but it did have a softer suspension (new Model 3 may have the updated suspension though) which may have been while it felt more like the Leaf. At the time it was like $50k for the Mach-E and $67k for the Y, I would consider the Mach-E with that price difference. I was deciding between the $30k Bolt and $55k Model Y but in the end if my family was in an accident I wanted to make sure I wouldnt feel guilty for cheeping out if I could afford it and road trips with a kid the Y is better than the 3 (and Bolt is not a good enough road trip car) but the 3 charges miles faster and I prefer driving it so if single I would pick the 3. As always I recommend trying to test drive a couple brands, see what you like. Good luck and as long as you choose a BEV thank you."
"I started with a dual motor model 3 now have an S plaid. When I got the model 3 it was the best car I ever owned. I commuted 130 miles 3x days per week and it was the best commuter car you could hope for. Super comfy seats, no engine noise/vibration, cheap to operate, and autopilot made highway driving easy. Would listen to podcasts and just relax. I did several cross country trips, one to glacier national park, TX, and more. Loved it. Great car. Mine was bulletproof, never had to do a thing other than wiper fluid."
"If you are going used, you should be aware of the major milestones of the Model 3. Here is what I remember off the top of my head but maybe there is a better guide online somewhere * Prior to Mid-2019 * Seats where Gen 1 and much less comfortable * There where known window controller issues - $300 out of warranty * There where known charging port issues - $1800 out of warranty * There were known camera problems - $300 out of warranty * Autopilot wasnt standard and was a $4k option so be sure the car has that. * For a short period they sold EAP so you might get that on a used car in this range. * For most of first half of 2019 FSD was $3k or less * Cars of this vintage come with homelink garage openers standard * All these cars had HW2.5 FSD computer in them and the upgrade to HW3 is $2500 + the cost of the monthly service. Might need this for autopilot in the future when they merge FSD driver into AutoPilot so its worth thinking about but who knows. * No CCS Adapter support * After to Mid-2020 * The interior console changed to matt black and was redesigned * Added a power trunk * Heating changed to a heat pump * USB-C plugs * After December 2021 * AMD Ryzen infotainment upgrade"
"This sub is unpredictable when a question is asked about Tesla... I am going to go grab a bag of pop corn now and will be back. Btw, it might be helpful to note where you live as CCS charging stations are more widely available in certain regions and countries."
"There have been countless times where I really appreciated the small features of the car, many of which are rarely mentioned in reviews. 1) In general, everything feels tight and high quality. The quality issues in the early days no longer apply. <br> 2) Its crazy that most new cars still dont have a wireless charging pad, let alone for 2 phones. While I always loved Android Auto in my Volt, there were a number of communications/cable issues that meant I have to drive without. Being able to just set your phone down and go is so satisfying. No messy cable. And no having to wait to launch the AA/CarPlay app when you sit down. 3) Phone as key, and being able to grant/revoke guest access from the app. I went on a road trip in a full car this summer, and was able to give guest keys to everyone, then take away their aceess when the trip ended. I never used the key card. I had a key fob in my Volt, but this is 100x easier. No need to pass someone your fob if they need to run out to the car to grab something. 4) Level 2 charging at home is practically a requirement, even though the Supercharger network is incredible. It is just too easy and cheap. I went all out and purchased the adapter kit, but have yet to use it. The 358 mile range on the LR is something all EV doubters should experience. Btw, there are a number of places that non-Teslas still cant travel to. (Im looking at you, Yellowstone.) 5) The app in general. Everything just works, and doesnt require a subscription like with OnStar or have a trial period. I can make the car fart in the quick menu, but I can also adjust the climate settings from the backseat. I know you only asked for 1, but theres just too many! Thanks for coming to my TED talk. P.S.: supercharge.info has a running list of all the new sites going up. Its insane how there are new sites going up 7 days a week."
"2023 Model 3 RWD, about 1k miles in. Ive driven a 21 Mach E Premium, 22 ID4 Pro S, 23 BMW i4 M40, and 23 Polestar 2, and a 20 (previous gen) Model 3 Performance. The 23 Model 3 is a good car. I have had a poor experience with delivery and service, but from a pure drivers experience, its quite good. Pros - Enjoyable to drive: good performance, steering, and regen braking - Driver profiles: if you have ANYONE else driving your car this is a godsend. Seat/steering wheel memory, regen braking settings, mirrors, etc. Its amazing. - Actual usable Nav: Not a big deal in ICE cars with Apple Carplay or Android Auto, but having to use built in nav to pre-condition the battery is a pain in poor nav software. Tesla wins here (but i still wish they had Carplay/AA) - Supercharger Network - Tesla App: Not perfect, but the best mobile app out there for your EV. Most importantly its quite reliable. Even simple things like using phone as key just *works*. My friend with an Ioniq5 hates the app and has to carry his key fob with him because it isnt reliable. - Value (for the base model RWD): At just under $40k with the tax credit, the base model comes pretty much fully equipped minus a better sound system, some interior lighting, and fog lights. For comparison, the Polestar 2 base model doesnt come with a heat pump, pano roof, premium sound system, fog lights, HDA, or blind spot monitoring. BMW i4 doesnt come with HDA or parking assistance as standard either. Yes, you can add them but now they are in an entirely different price bracket. - OTA Updates: The recent holiday update gave Auto-Turn Signals which auto turns off your turn signal after making a lane change. A nice QOL adjustment from the S and X. Tesla has proven that they roll them out consistently and do make your ownership better. - Big modding community: Mods arent for me, but a result of having such a big and developed modding community means that there is a wealth of information on how to take apart and put your car back together. Add on that the car itself is pretty simple to assemble, and its not hard to do many small repairs or replacements yourself. For example, if you broke a tail light, you can order a part on ebay for like $100 and install it yourself pretty easily in 10 minutes. Cons - Build quality: Its still a problem. Paint is soft and chips easily. Panel gaps are unavoidable. Its likely youll encounter some rattles or unwanted noises in your car. Ive already been to the service center 3 times within my first month of ownership. I have a mobile appointment set up for a driver seat rattle next week. Service centers are hit or miss. Because of poor QC, you have tons of new owners clogging the centers because delivery team just gets them to accept and then go to SC. They are overworked and understaffed, and as a result SC quality is hit or miss. For me, its been a miss. - Ride quality: New models are better (compared to the 2020 I drove), but its still noisy inside. Suspension is stiff and the ride is rougher than most other EVs out there. Out of every non-Tesla EV I drove, this one is the second worst (20 M3P was the worst) Highly recommend getting 18"" wheels and adjusting PSI if your range permits. - No USS/Radar: Specific to 2023 models, but not having USS, or a working alternative, is unacceptable. Luckily, I never had parking sensors so Im used to not having them, but to remove them without an alternative ready is asinine. - While the software and UI is pretty good, I still wish I had physical buttons for certain things. - No Apple Carplay or Android Auto. Built in Nav is probably the best in the industry (minus Android Automotive), but I do prefer having Carplay up. As a result I have Waze on my phone on a mount even with Tesla Nav on the screen. - No hatchback: The Polestar 2 and I4 are both sedan-looking, but they have hatchback trunks. This makes loading and unloading the trunk so much easier (also side note: the Polestar hands free trunk access is SO GOOD. I really wish Tesla had this feature) Overall, I think the base RWD is a great value (with the tax credit). Its the best feature rich EV at its price point by a good margin. When looking at the Long Range or Performance, I think its harder to justify, especially with the tax credit in limbo. I would not buy a LRM3 at $58k, or the Performance at $63k when you can get the RWD for $40k. At the $60k price bracket, the value just isnt there anymore. If the LR gets a price change to get under $55k for the tax credit, which I think is likely, then its a good buy. For $8k more (compared to the RWD), youll get AWD, longer range, more performance, and some minor features (fog lights, better sound system)"
"Switched from a Model 3 to an F-150 Lightning. I miss the software, UI, and mostly the super charging network. The EA network is absolutely horrendous and that’s not an overstatement. I took a road trip from TX to CA it was a musician I made it."
"I was a both Model S and 3 owner and now drive the BMW i4. Model 3, IMHO, was a cheaply made car and relied on the Tesla infotainment to make up for quality manufacturing. Getting back to a BMW I realized what I was missing out and how awesome it feels to drive a quality product daily. Wouldn’t touch Tesla again"
"My 0.02$… * Comparable to other premium cars as far as repairs go (Audi , bmw etc). Bumper 1-2k , windshield 1k, door handle 200-300$ Edit: Apparently cheapest luxury brand :  * That being said there’s a lot less to fix comparatively * Better than any other car I’ve owned in winter * updates 4yr into ownership just doesn’t exist anywhere else * cheaper fuel * Suspension rattles quickly into ownership (think ford explorer type degradation) * Tons of fun (geico piggy type of thing … we we weeeee!) * Slightly overpriced (awd at 40k with EAP would sell like hotcakes). Currently 53k pre-tax * would buy again (particularly if prices keep falling as they have in China ) * EAP is good but FSD isn’t worth it to buy outright Edit: As droid4ever said , not futzing with an app to charge is really nice (I’ve used EA and … wow). As they said software is much higher quality with Tesla"
"Ive owned the more commons EVs before the last few years. Prius Prime, egolf, leaf, Ioniq EV. The Model 3 was probably my favorite most balanced car Ive ever had. The seats hurt my back though. Its very weird and I dont know anyone else who this happens to."
"I can compare my 2015 BMW 335i to my 2021 Tesla 3 LR with AB. I run the same tires on both cars so its a good comparison. The Tesla is by far the best sport sedan Ive ever driven. Cornering is extremely flat and balanced (the BMW was balanced but way too much body roll), steering feel is on par or better, steering accuracy is better, acceleration is obviously phenomenal. The best difference tho is probably just the fact its an EV with high Regen. Immediate acceleration AND deceleration with perfect throttle response make it an absolute joy to drive compared to any automatic transmission (which is never in the right gear and always takes forever and a day to downshift). Storage space is great. Have done long weekend trips with my young girls and have been able to carry everything. Noise level is better (2021s are much better in this respect), suspension comfort is equivalent to marginally better (overall very good), rattles and squeaks are maybe slightly increased (only during large bumps) but both did not have any issue here, seats are way more comfortable and perhaps the best Ive ever sat in, room for car seats is equivalent to slightly better. The touchscreen is surprisingly easy and convenient to use. Basic autopilot is mostly awesome and adaptive cruise works very well (has seemed to get much better recently, last 6 months or so). Not having a gauge cluster is one of the things I thought I would hate and now do not want to have again (the visibility is so good). The negatives: low bumper for better aero means more rock strikes on the hood and windshield (already replaced a windshield), the doors feel cheap and flimsy like a Honda and not solid like a bank vault (ie Euro made premium car), paint is soft and easily chipped (likely due to California regulations)."
"2019 M3 SR+ and I never plan to go away from Tesla. Best car I’ve ever owned. Don’t underestimate the charging network’s importance. It’s a clear differentiator. Tesla service for two cracked windshields (rocks), new tires at 44k mi, and front control arm replacement under warranty have been smooth, professional and reasonably priced, except for some minor instances getting the car back with broken interior panel clips and needed replacement."
"Well I don‘t own another EV so can’t really speak to that. As for the Model 3, I’ve had no reliability issues thus far. Most of the issues I’ve had are fit and finish issues…which don’t bother me that much, but would probably irritate a lot of owners especially at the price these cars are going for nowadays. Quality of service can be hit or miss, but it’s always rushed and impersonal at least in my experience. It’s not uncommon for the car to go into service for one issue, and to come out with several more…again, in my experience. Supercharger network is great for longer trips, but I mostly charge at home. Unless you will be using it daily, it probably isn’t that important when choosing an EV imo."
"I started with a MY and now my garage have a MY and a M3. Teslas are the most convenient car I’ve ever own or driven. If you pick at any one thing it might not necessarily be the best compared to other EVs but like an IPhone the integrated experience is simple and seamless. A Tesla offers a very minimalist experience but it has absolutely everything you need for a convenient experience. I’m at 21K miles on the MY now and the only work I need to do on it is to add washer fluid and I’m probably looking at a new set of tires around 25K miles. The regular, free, and actual useful feature OTA updates on the car means the car is better and more useful today than the day I took delivery. When I picked up the car, my car didn’t have sentry camera views from the car and side view cameras on blinkers just to name two of the features I’ve gotten. Does other automakers make good EVs? Sure. Are other EVs better than Tesla’s in some respects? Sure. But having owned two Teslas for the past 2 years I don’t really want to trade in the Supercharger network and the superior SW experience of a Tesla to get say the fit and finish of a Toyota or a more accurate range gauge on the car (You should be using the Nav to estimate your SoC at the destination instead of using the stated range anyways cuz the Nav takes environmental factors and elevation gains into account). At the end of the day, a Tesla car is like Apple iPhone; it’s specs might not be the best and you’d have to pay a premium but it’s the best integrated experience that you can get."
"After 94k miles on the Model 3, I’m still wondering what people do at “Tesla service” unless they wrecked their car? I’ve had zero issues."
"It’s really hard to beat the software on Teslas. You won’t miss things you think you will. Remember though, this is an echo chamber both good and bad, your best chance for real information is look for the local Tesla club, and talk to real people who own them."
Sounds like your mind is made up. Why bother researching then ?
"I have a dual motor M3 which I purchased in September 2021. It was manufactured in China. Negatives: * Ive had multiple issues with errors from the charging port, which required a couple of visits to the service center and the eventual replacement of the charging assembly, which made the problem go away. Later a ""bad"" software update caused more phantom errors which went away. * The front left wheel initially made a crunching sound which required the wheel be removed and the brake disc to be sanded down. * One of the rear passenger doors used to stick a bit when closing but it went away over time. * The usual complaints about autopilots limitations. I find it useless except on a limited access highway, and there it can give up unexpectedly, sometimes ""crash"" (""system failure""), and sometimes cause unexpected braking for no apparent reason. * Speed limit detection and adjustment are buggy and sometimes surprisingly bad. * ""580km range"" means 450km in highway usage at 120km/h. * It was unusually quiet in the highway at first but over time it has become much noisier. I suspect the door seals degrade quickly. Positives: * Autopilot does a great job of lanekeeping and maintaining distance. It has trained me to stay attentive but allows for my occasional distraction. IMO it will never be capable of ""full self driving"" but its certainly a useful tool, but it does have a steep learning curve. I always use it and my husband does not as he finds it easier just to drive. * The mobile app works very well and the car responds quickly. I use my phone as the key and dont carry the key card at all. * The drive is smooth and the interface is pretty intuitive. Acceleration is excellent (even without paying for the ""boost""). * Visibility is excellent and the cameras and vehicle detection make lane changes much easier and safer. Notes: * Take special care in washing the front window and all cameras for good Autopilot performance. * Mine has bumper sensors which I consider an absolute *must have*. Parking spaces in Europe are tiny and garages are dark, and ""Tesla Vision"" isnt going to cut it. I wouldnt buy one without them, period, and thats what theyre selling now. * The brand used to be cool but the Muskrat effect is real. Im probably going to have the decals removed."
"Pretty much the exact opposite of the impression you must be getting on the internet. Its without a doubt the best car Ive ever owned, and Ive owned about 12 cars in my life. Its so good in fact that we sold my wifes CR-V for a MYP last year. The online negativity towards the brand is hugely skewed. Ill bet most of the folks in, say r/realtesla dont even own a Tesla."
"Had a Kia Niro EV. It was a fine car. Very efficient, but didnt have the tech and features of a Model 3. The Model 3 is a little bit of a bumpier ride, but not bad at all. The tech features are what sold me. Sentry mode, cameras recording while driving, and all the app features. Seems to be fine. I havent had any major repairs or problems yet. (I hate Elon and Im learning to hate myself every day with his antics) 😅"
"We’ve had a Leaf, Model S, RAV4 EV, Model X, 3 and a Y. The RWD LR M3 is my favorite to drive of all of them."
"If you plan on any long distance travel, I would ONLY recommend a Tesla (my experience is in the southeast US). People are seeing EVgo charging stations pop up all over and think it’s a done deal. However, they are not as available or reliable as the Tesla network. I would still be hesitant to own another EV unless it was only a daily driver."
"I’ve had my M3LR since Dec 2021 and its been the best car I’ve had, no faults at all and I love taking it for a drive every time! I’ll be looking to go with a S or M3P next time round. I don’t do many long trips as I live in the UK so its hard to really travel many miles but on the few times I’ve done 600-800 mile trips away from home the Supercharger network has been flawless. If you wanna drive one Tesla are always email me to test drive a Y, if you have a service centre near you inquire about a 3 test drive!"
"Ive had mine for about two months and love it. I went for the LFP car because Im frugal and I really wanted the longevity, I keep my stuff for a long time so this car will probably be with me 10-15 years. You get all the good Tesla stuff for much less money and I dont need ultimate speed anymore. I looked at other EVs but the base car is such a great value at 46k compared to the others in its price bracket. Way more performance, generally more range, and I really like all the tech you get with it. Also availability was a large part, the Ioniq and others were marked up like crazy and I could painlessly buy the Tesla. Picking it up was a breeze. Quality wise Im very happy with my car, no fitment or QC issues, the refreshed interior is really nice (it feels much better than the older cars). I havent had to deal with service yet but its very easy to make an appointment. If you damage the car it is kind of a pain, from what I hear itll take a while and the car has a lot of aluminum which is expensive to work with and replace. The only gripe is that they are pretty stingy with the paint, I paid for the Blue color and it looks fantastic but in some of the hard to reach places there isnt full coverage. But you dont see that unless you go looking for it. One the road its extremely smooth, one pedal driving is calibrated perfectly. Very little wind noise in the cabin, its quieter than all my previous cars and its what you would expect for a 40 grand car. If youre paying 60k+ for a performance (essentially the same car, different motor) I can see wanting it to be better, but for the price I have no complaints. Over smooth or smooth-ish roads its very quiet inside, over really rough surfaced pavement youll hear it a bit. Its not as quiet as an ID4 in the regard. Handling is great and its fun in the twisties, no complaints on power. I prefer a slightly stiffer ride so the suspension works great for me, its very comfortable but a tick more in the sporty camp than plush. Nice damping over sharp bumps, no wallowing. I would just lower tire pressure, 45 PSI feels like driving on rocks. I have the 18"" wheels so take that into account, the larger wheels will probably feel different but I live in the Bay Area and you need sidewall here. Charging is GREAT. The battery is fairly small and the curve is nice, youre looking at coming from 10-60% in \~12 minutes, 10-80% in \~18 minutes. The supercharger network is fantastic. I love that I can charge to 100% daily if I want to. Efficiency is amazing, at 70mph I get 4.4wh/mi, 3.4wh/mi 85mph. This is during the winter, when it was around freezing I only got about 10% worse (heat pumps work great). I havent driven the car yet when its over 55 degrees outside yet, so it should get even better."
I Hope you hadn’t pulled the trigger till today . Nice price drop.
"I love ours, also in SoCal. No real issues in 2 years of ownership. Had a rattle that was quickly taken care of. Replaced a 2011 A4 Quattro."
"Uk here. Best and cheapest car I have owned. Quality of build from China is very good too, less rattling than other cars despite what everyone else says"

"Ive had mine for 4 years now (early 2019 model AWD). The thing just works. No squeaks, rattles, panel gaps, ... Still as much a joy to drive as on day one (plus all the goodies that have since come in with OTA). The white interior holds up astonishingly well. Repairs: Ive had the blinker stalk replaced early on (under warranty) because it would sometimes not do the 3-blinker-turn-indicator thing reliably. Almost not worth doing but they fixed it quickly. (I also dinged the rear fender (my fault). Just took it to a body shop to have it doctored and painted. Cost was what I would have paid for such a repair on any other car.) Interaction with service center has been hassle free (blinker stalk replacement; tire changes summer/winter; once to have brake fluid checked and cabin filter replaced). Scheduling via app is smooth and work was always done in about an hour with constant updates so I could go do some shopping/grab some breakfast in the meantime. It passed the bi-annual mandatory checkup (TÜV) with flying colors (fun experience as it was the first one they had seen). Have not had any problems with superchargers. Plug & play every time. I have also not encountered a broken one, yet. I probably wouldnt go to another charger even if it was slightly cheaper - just because its so convenient and there are always so many stalls. Ive not noticed any dramatic extra tire wear (but I dont drive like maniac so I wasnt expecting any). Since I usually get new tires a bit before they are totally worn down my change schedule hasnt changed from my previous ICE car. Range/battery degradation: About 5% degradation. It hasnt impacted driving times since range is only relevant on long range trips and I still reach the same supercharger stops as before. Autopilot: AP is cool (I only have the basic one). I use it every day. Noise: Friend of mine has a 2021 Model 3 and that is noticeably quieter at highway speeds (though I wouldnt say that mine is loud. Its just something to be aware of and test when buying) Only downside so far: Insurance isnt cheap. I wish they would offer Tesla insurance where I live."
"Lovely vehicle, no real issues charging on trips. Reliability is hard to say since it’s only 3 years old, it hasn’t left me stranded in the middle of the road, unlike my Jetta’s perennial mass airflow sensor issues. There’s not a lot there in terms of repairing yourself. The motors are sealed, the battery pack is sealed. You’d basically be limited to doing body work or fixing auxiliary systems like the AC."
"My M3LR has excellent fit and finish and most everything works flawlessly, including Autopilot. My lone complaint is substandard wipers, but I mitigated that with a ceramic coating on the glass."
"I got a 21 Tesla Model 3 LR. In mid-21 there were a handful of EVs to choose from, much less than today, so I went on a spree test-driving EVs. I went with 3 because it was the most efficient at the time, had excellent range, the Tesla charge infrastructure is prevalent in my region and had a good reputation, and by far it drove and handled best (particularly one-pedal driving). The price was <$50K I did not buy “Full Self-driving” as it seemed half-baked and the price was to high for the value. The car has been reliable, at least over the 17K miles so far. I’ve driven on a few regional road trips without any issues. It handles snow and ICE better than my Toyota, but I’m also wary because it’s heavier. My issues so far: I had a tail light that had filled with condensation, which the service center swapped out for free in about 90 minutes. Also, The v11 software update had some stupid II changes (that they later addressed). Also, I once had phantom braking while using Autopilot (traffic aware cruise control) that I responded to by pressing the accelerator - most of the time it works astonishingly well. The app integration works very well. I use the remote climate control and scheduled departures all the time. I was once cut off by a bus and the emergency braking did a good job at preventing collision. The UI is easily the best of the EVs I tried (Mach E, ID.4, Kona). The steering wheel controls and voice commands pretty much eliminate the need for touching the display while driving. The auto wipers usually work well, but certain situations still stymie them; you can touch the stalk button to wipe once and bring up buttons on the UI to override, but I usually use a voice command instead. The auto headlights work well, but sometimes the auto-high beams don’t respond fast enough for my liking so I disable them by pushing on the stalk. Storage-wise, the trunk is very deep, and the under-trunk decent-sized. It’s not a hatchback, though. The frunk is reasonably sized. I keep the mobile charger, a blanket, a backseat cover for the dog, and an ice-scraper in there and there’s space remaining. I’m pleased with it. We have this and a Prius and we drive this pretty much all the time and the Prius when my wife and I have to be two different places at the same time (the one that has to drive farthest gets the Tesla)."
I’ve had my Model 3 LR for a year now and it’s been absolutely lovely. No issues and it’s by far the most fun / convenient car I’ve driven. Also upgraded w/ acceleration boost this past summer. No regrets so far.
"Tesla is actually an incredibly easy car to live with. Easy to charge. Just get in and go. Good battery and reliable powertrain. Definitely has quality issues with fit and finish, but that varies. Overall the model 3 is a great vehicle when said and done"
"I have one of the first Model 3s, 2018, RWD, long range. Loves: Zero maintenance. Excellent road trip car, comfortable, great range, fast charging. Even the non-performance is ridiculously quick, way faster than any ""sport sedan"". App & phone key are awesome. Problems: Charge port door replaced twice. Body control module replaced. Little clip that holds the rear seat down replaced. All under warranty. Nags: cant fit large items in back like Model S. Why is the steering wheel so small it makes me feel like a giant."
"I drove a 2012 Leaf for 3 years, a 2017 Bolt for 1 year and a 2022 Model 3 RWD for 1 year. I loved both the Leaf and Bolt-both were completely reliable and needed nothing maintenance wise in the time I owned them. However I just took my Model 3 on a 3200 mile round trip last month from NY to Florida and it was surprisingly painless. I never took my Bolt on anything farther than 400 miles round trip…even with a faster charging CCS equipped vehicle it’s hard to imagine it would have been as easy as the Tesla. I only had to contact Tesla for one minor issue with a rear door hinge noticed after delivery. Also relatively painless, made service appointment, deferred to a local body shop and had the car back in a few days at no cost. The only real gripe I have is that living in a state that requires annual safety inspections, it’s frustrating that Tesla can’t inspect their own cars (due to state requirements they would need the equipment for emissions testing on ICE vehicles which they don’t have)- there are specific jacking instructions that require lift pads to not damage the frame/battery, and Tesla is very clear that damage caused by improper lifting will not be covered under warranty. Leaving the manual page and my own set of jack pads on the console, giving instructions to the service tech…there’s still no way to know if the mechanic is actually following instructions or if they think they know better. I took my Leaf and Bolt to their respective dealers for inspection with no concern."
"We got a Leaf, Ioniq, Kona EV, Ioniq 5 and and EV6 over the past years. We also had a 2015 Tesla S 70D and now a Tesla 3 SR 2022. We kept the Tesla 3 and sold all the other cars. EV6 / Ioniq 5 were great, and the best non-Tesla EV we got to drive. It was better on some levels: Sound proofing, power and more space inside. Downsides were software that is years worse than Tesla. The 2015 software on the S was way better and also the car is overweight compared to a Tesla Y. ( > 10%). Daily experience is better with the Tesla 3 and that is the one we kept. My guess is that a Tesla Y SR will be released soon and it will be very competitive."
"Important note, a 2018 Tesla 3 is not equal to a 2022 Tesla 3. Tesla has done continuous improvement (sound proofing, efficiency, range, quality) over the years. Keep this in mind when you compare."
Just want to say its nice to see a question like this get answered positively by so many owners. Theres so much negativity in the press and on reddit when it comes to Tesla.

"i own 5 cars - 1964 ford galaxie fully built, 2007 dodge ram for towing, 2002 corvette z06 for track, 2022 MODEL 3, 2016 Model X (wifes car). Model 3 is the best car ever, hands down. in every way. Model X is awesome too. havnt had any issues with the M3. X screen went out, but otherwise its great, and its the first year of production. Love these cars."
"Love it. Best car Ive ever owned. Fastest, too."
"The Model 3 is my first EV, picked up in Nov 2022, came from a Corolla. Never had an expensive car like a BMW but my friends do, so I have very little experience in the ""premium feel."" I love the leather seats, much more comfortable than the Toyota and a little better (IMO!!!) than the 330i seats as I like cushiony feel over firm, like my mattress preference. The big screen vs knobs debate is overblown for me as the only 2 things I am messing with are heat/AC and wipers, both of which I set via voice. Even with knobs in the Toyota, I still had to look to set the heat to the right type (up towards the glass vs straight at you vs down by feet) so I never got the ""muscle memory"" argument. I have a garage with 240V charger and dont really do roadtrips, so the Supercharger network is nice as peace of mind but I doubt Id use it much. Instead, Im REALLY a fan of the LFP batteries Tesla uses in the RWD trim I have as range degradation was almost nothing for me and my driving style (opposite of a lead foot) during the negative F temperatures at the end of Dec. The app is also really nice to have - I like being able to precondition while indoors and walk up to the car and it just unlocks with my phone in pocket and goes. It just werkz™️. Updates install nicely and Ive never had to go near a Tesla business after picking up my car. Regen braking and steering are amazing and I hate driving any other car that isnt tuned this way anymore. Finally, had no issues with manufacturing defects. I feel these complaints are from pre-2019 and cases are more rare now, and people just circle jerk for karma. No gaps on my car, suspension is fine on the NJ and NYC roads with the filled in potholes. Overall, 10/10 experience so far 2 months in."
"I’ve put almost 100k miles in mine since buying it in 2018. I’ve road-tripped this on all-day drives several dozen times including cross-country. Supercharging is excellent and is more convenient than pumping gas (no needing to download and register with damn apps at every station). The software is equally excellent. I’ll probably never find a car that’ll match it, but Apple CarPlay is a mild contender. The car has so many features like dash cams, sentry mode, live-view, camp/dog mode, streaming video/games, etc. The interior is spartan but easy to clean and keep looking clean. I wasn’t coming from a luxury car so that was no big deal. I have to explain the door handles to almost everyone I give a ride to, so I’ve turned into a gentleman by opening the doors for my older friends. An instrument cluster/HUD and cooled seated would be nice. It’s a fantastic car. I’m almost considering upgrading to a Y with the price drops and 4 years of changes. And yes, some people are political about EVs, especially older people. Some ask really ignorant questions and have skewed perceptions that I must be living with severe limitations by driving an EV. Others are blown away and I’ve even had friends and family buy their own after driving mine."
"I moved away from my Tesla Model 3 LR after two years, mainly due to road noise. But I had also had several service appointments with Tesla to fix multiple rattles in the cabin, some of which were considered “within spec”. Aside from those issues I think it’s a great car: fantastic UX, fun to drive, _extremely_ efficient (10-25% energy use compared to the competition), good interior space and software is best in class. If the road noise (which is quite a bit worse than the competition despite what some might say, also after I had spent €1500 aftermarket for professional noise dampening) hadn’t been an issue, I would still be driving my Model 3. Instead I now drive a BMW."
"So your saying you don’t like…. Android/Apple car play, XM Satellite Radio, Cooled seats, a shade for your Panoramic sun roof, a smooth ride with a quiet cabin, Most importantly a HUD to keep your eyes on the road and not on a screen? Tesla is not the only option anymore keep your mind open to other brands. Yes, Tesla has great cars but some people don’t want a Steering wheel, a Single screen for UI and some seats. Less is more, May work for some people. But I’m personally a More is More kind of person. That’s why I chose the Ioniq 5 Limited over the M3 Performance or the MY. For me I will get political and I wouldn’t give Elon a red cent."
"Ive owned 2 Teslas, a 2015 Model S and 2018 Model 3. From the factory the Model S was missing the lining in the trunk and the Model 3 had a mismatched wheel. Both issues were taken care of but still not something you expect for a luxury car and a high priced sedan. Performance wise both were better than most other EVs Ive driven but didnt really need or use the performance of them 95% of the time. Real world driving range vs rated range was kind of a joke on both. Expect about 10-15% less than what Tesla says it will do. Integrated technology (Route planning, navigation, internet connectivity, etc) was nice and far better than any other manufacturer has done. But the lack of apple Carplay/Android Auto, satellite radio, and not having physical buttons for common controls is kind of annoying. And even though I am a full supporter of over the air updates, the constant changes to the UI so you have to relearn where things are displayed or how to get to a setting the various menus are infuriating half the time. The Model 3 is loud on the road. Newer ones are better than my 2018 but for an EV where you expect a quiet cabin, they are still quite loud. We got a Chevy Bolt EUV after a truck wrecked my Model 3 and I swear it is noticeably quieter while driving even for a car that is like $20k cheaper than a Model 3. Fast charging is super easy on the Tesla network, which is probably the last major advantage Tesla has over other car makers now. Not having to mess with an app, card, or touch display to start charging is something I wish other charging networks would get right."
"I have an S which convinced two friends to get performance model 3s. Each has about 50K miles and no repairs. One has had three sets of tires, TeslaCorsa will do that to ya but is a testament to how durable they are. I must disclose that one had a misaligned trunk and the other a loose door panel. Both fixed at SC but a trip that should not have been needed."
Supercharger network unbeatable in the USA Cabin air filter is terrible I have to change every 30k miles or it smells like wet socks Quality can be improved Yes EV runs cheaper then ice by a lot
"I loved my model 3, drove across country twice, with only little inconvenience. In terms of a car, it feels like 10 years ahead of anything else. Like a smart phone when everyone else is using flip phones still. Sold it to go carless cuz fuck cars."
"build quality is garbage, had a 2020 and fsd crashed car for me. glad to be able to walk away"
"Owned for 3.5 years and its awesome, still. A better car than I bought originally"
Build and Ride quality was subpar when I had a 2020 for about 6 months. You could see the ground outside at bottom of passenger right door. Felt like riding on a skateboard.
My thoughts: 
I’ll let you know as soon as they drop the price! 😁
"Have had mine for a year - zero issues with the car itself, it’s a joy to drive. There are issues with the mobile network provider in Switzerland, though - but this is local. Tesla chose an el-cheapo provider here with lousy coverage. Infotainment services often don’t work. Other than that, I love the car."
"Pretty amazing. Very happy with it. Is the experience perfect? No. Better than any car I’ve owned, and the list includes BMW’s, VW’s, Toyota, Minis."
Its the best
I love it. Best thing I’ve ever owned!
Is it me or is there a massive chip on the tip of the piece under the Tesla logo??
"I love the car and the simplicity of it, the fact that the quality has gotten a lot better but God I hate the way this brand handles things. How can you have a 70k+ car without sensors,... Unacceptable"
"Must be annoying for you guys with the US builds not really knowing what you get. Got my 2023 MYLR mid Dec delivery that has matrix headlights, USS and the comfort suspension. China build though. It’s also been keyed already and sentry wasn’t enabled at the time so I guess you win some and lose some."
"I took delivery in September. That seems to be the sweet spot, only a 2022, but my MYLR has USS and matrix headlights. If only they couldve temporarily added radar back in the mix. 😂"
Wait they took out the ultrasonic sensors too? And the homelink? And theres a paid acceleration upgrade? I was thinking of getting a new model Y to upgrade my 2018 model 3 but it sounds like the feature set is actually . . . Worse?
How do you know if you got the matrix or not? I took delivery in early dec and not sure how to tell the diff
Looks nice. Just picked mine up same color but it has 7 seats and sensors.
"In the US, Model Y has (consistently, at least) come standard with LED Matrix Projector headlights only in the Performance version ever since the lights were launched in the US. Recently, apparently some Model Y Long Range in the US did get them."
"I just got the same configuration! Then I logged into Reddit to see all this stuff about not having USS, possible price drops, and a new battery in the near future. This must be what it feels like to be a Tesla fan! Woo!"
Im in Houston and I got mine from California lol. With uss and matrix 😍 just 2 months ago
"I forgot to mention my tires are not Michelin, it’s Continental. I saw some with good year. Looks like they were all coming from Austin, Texas."
Looks so much cleaner without the ultrasonic sensors. /s
"Looks nice! I also picked up a MYP last week in CA, Fremont build, same ""ticket me red!"" I have the matrix headlights because of the Y but of course no USS which I would have liked for parking in the garage, etc."
"Picked mine up yesterday at Fremont factory…MLR7, white interior and came with matrix headlights, no USS, no cargo cover. Except for five or six small issues which I have already put in a service request for, I am happy with the purchase."
cool!
Matrix seem only to be coming from early December fremont builds. Probably temporary like last time
But with new cameras
So much cleaner looking without the sensors
Must be Fremont build
"How does it feel with the ""comfort suspension""?"
No USS. ☹️
[deleted]
[deleted]
Mine dec delivery doesn’t even have the tesla logo on the frunk
"The car had circle in the front bumper, isn’t uss?"
Whats the advantage of matrix headlights right now anyway?
"Looking at other reddit posts, uss is being disabled anyway. 🤔. Tesla vision is where they are moving forward."
Why wouldn’t you want more sensors on your electric murder sedan?
"Thats pretty much our exact same car down to the factory. We love it so far. Ours got front PPF and a ceramic coating and looks fantastic. I also curbed the rear passenger rim the first time driving it. Just a small nick, but thankfully nothing since!"
curious to know what autopilot cameras it has. the 1.5MP or the 5MP ones?
2023 model y lr Matrix headlight No uss Fremont built
[deleted]
So “getting less for more” is the new company slogan? Should have rejected delivery. Paint issues and reduced functionality should not be rewarded.
That kid is god awfully close. 😂
"Yeah all long range Y do not have matrix headlights. That’s since the beginning, which makes no sense to me because all versions of the model 3 have matrix head lights. The performance y has them though…"
Smoof.
Whats the benefit of NOT having the matrix headlights?
"Oh no, what does this mean for matrix headlights? I was expecting them to be enabled before 2023, since the hardware is already there. (Chinese 2022 MYLR, Europe)."
"I didn’t even think of selling back to Tesla. Can you tell me how that process went for you, and how the price compared?"
You forgot the auto wipers.
"Good balanced review, my 4 year Model 3 experience lines up almost 100%. Was a great car for the price back then, now theres too much competition to take some of the warts at this price range. A/C seems to be a frequent issue. One of my neighbors got a Model 3 a year after me and ended up back&forth to service all summer trying to get it fixed. Even in a car with working Heat & A/C, the A/C is not very powerful in the Model 3/Y. Stepping into a competing car I was shocked how much more quickly the car could come come down to temperature & automatically maintain it without lots of fiddling. Also physical air vent controls are mandatory for me again. Phantom braking is a huge issue, almost all owners will sheepishly admit they have experienced. It gets better and worse with software updates. Easily happened 1 times per 100mi highway driving on Autopilot. Further, the alert noise to get the driver to take over steering in AP confusion events frightens the whole car. Got about 1 per 100mi of those too. Theres some conjecture that it happens more on Model Y due to the training data being mostly Model 3 and the camera locations being slightly different. Not to mention the removal of radar. It was somewhat random and hard to predict where it might happen. $15k for FSD is clearly robbery, but even $6k for EAP is aggressive considering competing brands offering competent highway assist in the base package or for max $2k as an option. I think 2017-2020, if you could get an AWD Model 3 for $50k range after tax incentives, it was a no-brainer given the price & competition. Anyone looking in 2022-2023 and contemplating putting down $70-80k for a Model Y really, really, really need to go test drive the competition. There was a brief moment you could get a Model S and even Model X in the $80k range back in pre-2020 era. At that price range you can get cars with luxury interiors, ventilated seats, massage seats, HUD, 3d-view, real blind spot detection, CarPlay/Android Auto, satellite radio, amazing speakers, etc. (Pricing note for the OPs spec: 20"" induction, 7 seater, non-white, LR (not Performance) Model Y with EAP (but not FSD) is now $79k)"
The phantom braking scares the absolute shit out of me. Thankfully it’s only happened to me about 2-3 times but it has happened to me on the freeway in the fast lane. Not ideal
"Great post! I’m a Tesla fan but don’t care for Elon. I think they should replace it’s CEO. Anyway, sorry, you had a bad experience!"
"Honestly, my wife is on her last year of school and we will be looking for a new vehicle when shes done. I like the idea of Tesla. This is probably the most honest review I have ever read. Seems like people either absolutely love Tesla or absolutely hate them. Thank you for this"
Braking*
Youre telling me your car arrived with broken or missing trim pieces? Cant fathom how this wouldve ever made it past PDI at any other major automaker. That is appalling.
"Nice post! If the heating and A/C worked, but you could still return it for a full refund and get something else, would you?"
"Really interesting, thanks. \> Door Handles - I was surprised at the amount of times people new to Tesla didn’t know how to open the doors. I can attest to this! I went in one for the first time the other day. The Uber driver rolled up but did not get out. He popped the boot so we could put our luggage in. I gently closed it but all sorts of horn sounds went off! So I got the fear and let the driver closed it remotely. Then of course it came to get in the car and I couldnt figure out the handle and didnt want to anger the driver further so just stood there like an idiot until someone wound down the window and told me how to get in."
Those darn broken phantoms!
"Im with you completely re. Elons antics reflecting poorly on the Tesla brand, not to mention the possible lack of leadership at Tesla. Ive never understood the appeal of FSD, basic autopilot is OK, about what youd expect from most current cars."
What have you decided to buy instead?
"You left out one very important ugly THEY DONT SELL PARTS! I love my MY, but have a serious problem with their company policies"
[deleted]
"I’ve had the same car for a year and I love it. Though most everything you listed, I agree with, lol. However, I have not had the ac issues you had. I’m also heavily reliant on the super chargers, due to my frequent travel. I wish you the best of luck with the polestar"
"For me those bad are just absolute dealbreakers. When I think tesla cars are trash those are all the reasons why. I dont see how autopilot can be a good given the phant braking though. Seems like that would disqualify it. Same with the center console. While not disqualifying I get that its snappy and works well, but if you cant do the basic things you want to do with it is it really that great? Especially because all the competitors have Android auto or car play that work great with any music service you want."
WTF are induction tires?!
"FSD is typical Elon conman conning people. That’s how he operates. Hyperloop, Neuralink, etc all cons"
The whole uncertainty around random bugs in a car and random bugs for things as vital as breaking… freaks me the fuck out
"What is going to be interesting in this comment section are the tesla fans with the west coast passive aggressiveness shoot down your experience. Thanks for posting and I hope this builds confidence for more people to share their stories (no matter the manufacturer). The more we all collectively put a magnifying glass to these companies, the better product we’ll get in the future with our dollars."
I heard the suspension is better now. Need to try it again later. What’s your next car?
So…what are you going to replace it with…?😏
"What are you getting next? I love my Mustang Mach-E, and the Ioniq 5 seems to be amazing too if you can find one without a $10K markup. The suspension thing is a problem in pretty much all electric cars I think, they just weight so much because of the batteries they have to make it super stiff."
"Bummer experience for you. We have many of the same observations with our Model 3, but we have had only minor quality problems. Overall, we still love the car. Having it to do over, we wouldnt have paid for the FSD feature. My wife is nervous with the car taking control, so it is a lot of money for something that we rarely use. Tesla offered the option to buy FSD at the time of purchase, but it at any time in the future (at whatever the price is at that time), or lease it by the month."
"Nice write up. I have not bought a MY myself but changed to an Ioniq5 shortly before delivery (love that car) but based on All my Research and test drive your points are Solid. I mean the broken heater is Bad luck I guess and quality issues appear to be absent in models from Shanghai and Berlin, but still great post"
FSD is lame and asking $10k for fake features constantly being added is INSANE. EVs are here and Im glad all the other REAL car makers are jumping on. We have a PHEV and I would not pay $80K CDN for a car with like many Model Ys interior quality.
"I completely agree about the one pedal drive, I think that’s my favorite feature of our Volvo XC40 Recharge."
"Model S door handles might be functionally better but having gone through 6 of them in 8 years, I can say with certainty that they are not practically better."
100%. I and my 2021 Model Y concur. I don’t want to cringe when I drive my car thinking about the village douchecanoe that runs the company and his ass-kissing mini-me online bootlickers.
Tesla needs a new CEO asap. Elon has lost the plot
"Thank you for taking the time to post this, super informative!"
">20” induction tires Stupid question perhaps, but what is an induction tire?"
"Really good post. Looks like great feedback. Honestly, the only real problem (to me) is the one you rightfully got it lemon lawd for. It is very disappointing they couldnt fix hvac issues since that is an ancillary system and not new technology. My biggest worry is quality control- I dont know how exaggerated it is on the internet (Tesla owners seem much more likely to post than, say, a Camry owner)."
[deleted]
I said it before but Teslas are some of the ugliest EVs. The S is decent and thats it.
"Ive put a deposit down more than once but have never been confident enough to pull the trigger on a Tesla. I think the tech is incredible but the service horror stories outweighed the great tech for me. Elon is a toxic human, honestly I dont think I will ever touch a product associated with him."
"I definitely don’t like the steering, it’s too twitchy and the turning radius is abysmal. Sucks to park the car in tight California spots because the car just won’t turn. One pedal isn’t also so good. In San Diego it’s quite hilly and the braking performance suffers going down hill. It doesn’t do a constant acceleration braking so sometimes it takes way too long to stop on a downhill slope. It also is too twitchy in normal mode where pushing it just a tiny bit gives you 30% acceleration off the bat so the car feels “faster”. So I drive in chill mode but then the accelerator feels like a rubber band and flooring it doesn’t kick it out of chill. When you quickly let go of the accelerator, regen takes a while to kick in. Too long in my opinion. Honestly the best accelerator dynamics where on my Nissan leaf. It was so responsive, downside was regen was much less and one pedal driving on that car was terrible because it took forever to start a regen. In regular mode regen kicked in instantly. BTW I just learned that for the overhead speakers to work, you need to select immersive sound to be high."
"On the auto high beams, the new .40 software update apparently made it finally work as it should"
"Not just racist factories, but factories where women are not safe and prone to sexual harassment. "
"Sorry if I missed this in the post, but are you going to get another Tesla? Or are you going to get a different EV?"
"I sold my 2021 MYLR in August specifically for the phantom braking and Elonss shadow. I had it for less than a year but I was able to get $4,500 over what I paid for it in October 2021. I agree about the front of the car. The more I looked at it, the more I disliked it. I also missed having a full dash. The tech on the screen is great but I prefer to have knobs and dials over trying to find things on the screen. We ended up getting a PHEV and we love it. We got a 2022 Jeep Wrangler Sahara 4xe. We are using the EV more than the ICE because of my work commute."
You nailed it!
I will never buy a Tesla because of Elon.
racist factories? Really?
Best honest review I have read ![gif](giphy|d31w24psGYeekCZy)
"Why is the CEO even a factor in the Tesla postmortem? If you were to review your TV, would you mention their CEO? 2 yrs with intermittent heating/AC is unacceptable. Glad it bought back by Tesla."
"Aw always sucks to be stuck with a lemon, I get that you want something new. Auto high beams very recently got an update and work much better now according to Bjorn on yt. The polestar 2 will be great too"
"Try a Kia EV6? I have had one for almost a year and 15k miles and it’s fantastic. Only issue is with connectivity with CarPlay cutting out sometimes. No drive train faults, no issues with heaters, both the heat pump or the resistive ones. Gets 3.3m/kwh average on the highway (70mph), and has one pedal driving in a more intuitive way on the paddle shifters then a Tesla. Great compliment to the telluride my wife owns, which has had no issues either. Both 2022 vehicles."
"I put down a deposit within 2 weeks of the 7 seater Model Y announcement. After 2 years of waiting on delivery, or at least any notification, I canceled the reservation. This was...June 2021 or so? My financial situation had changed, my old car had gotten too expensive to continue to repair, and Elon had been exposed as a big ol jerk. I was really looking forward to having the Model Y, but I cant understand why it took so long, when I was one of the first to put down a deposit."
This is a great example of why you should research your car purchases extensively before you buy.
"Tesla is absolutely the worst car to be around motorcycles, literally have killed many of us :( on accident"
Just order another Y. You just got a bad one or more.than likely Tesla Service is just not good with complicated problems.
So were doing Tesla hate posts every day. This sub is so EV positive!
>20” induction tires - These are beautiful. Probably the nicest looking thing on this car. Youre part of the problem.
You were doing so well then ruined it not knowing how to spell “brake”
In what world does the personality of the CEO come into consideration for likes and dislikes of a car. Lol this world is doomed.
Ah another lets bitch about Tesla post.
Lol...Elon a conman. The dude has made things a reality that others failed miserably. He breaks with the lockstep leftist agenda and now he sucks. The dude is a centrist to a fault.
Did you think about lemon-law’ing the car for the HVAC issues? Or was it too late by the time you had a lot of service visits for it?
"My vehicle will drive me to target, pretty much on its own and is multiple turns, so that doesnt really seem like a scam. Again, if there is a better car that will drive on its own, let me know."
"If course the ride was rough with those tires, and if you didnt buy self driving why complain?"
"Very stupid tantrum, haven’t experienced any of that besides the FSD being still on development (which I didn’t buy)"
Sorry you had a bad experience enjoy manually driving your new Kia 😆
"For Music— you said lack of native music apps, what about Spotify? To me that is the only one that really matters and they have it plus some other stuff"
"I actually dont have any issues with the blindspot camera at night. But I do wish that adaptive cruise control was adjustable based on your speed for follow distance, severity of braking, and how fast to accelerate. I wont touch FSD as I agree with you its a scam, so I dont get to experience most of the ""advanced"" features like auto lane change with lane keep assist"
"> **One Pedal Driving** - After using this, I cannot go back. I considered getting a hybrid after giving up on my Tesla, but I just don’t think I can go back to coasting, breaking, and having to putz around with the gas pedal. One pedal driving is an amazing experience, and Tesla nails it. Sorry, but this depends on the way you get used to driving. I still have a ICE car, and I use brake pedal just when I need to stop (traffic lights etc.) and emergencies of course. For reducing the speed, you just need to step off the ""gas"" pedal soon enough. Also, other EVs also have this feature (and many of the other good things you listed with lower amount of bad things you listed), so you can simply buy a different EV."
"Hi - can you elaborate on how many miles the car had, did they end up giving you any extra money or did they just buy it back based on Kelley blue book?"
"Curious OP, and sorry if you mentioned it elsewhere, but did you look into selling to Carvana/Vroom? I was able to move from my MY over to an R1T singularly because the 2-year old MY had appreciated $12k in value."
"That sucks. My Model 3 had a A/C issue since we are back from Summer camping trip. It took us 4 trips to get it fixed. The first 2 trips to one SC were wasting time: the guy kept draining/replacing the freon when its pressure was normal. The weird thing is the A/C always works perfectly in the first 10 minutes or so in the trip. it is no fun to drive in South Florida heat, so totally understand your feeling. Then I switched to a different SC. The technician showed me the error message: the A/C compressor was inhibited. He said th A/C compressor is overheating and was turned off to protected it. He ordered the A/C compressor and a week later, I dropped the car. He ended up only replacing a thermo sensor, and it worked well so far (for about 2 weeks). The part only cost 30$, but all the diagnostic (they charged 3 diagnostics) cost more than 800$. I am thinking if I can get the first 2 diagnostic fee back since they were all wrong, but I am still on the fence since they were at least honest for not replacing the compressor 😕"
Good move Op.
What are you going to move to? I have been looking around for an EV . Maybe assume a Model X lease.
"Thats why I didnt buy a Tesla until 2022. Great you lemon law them, forces them to get their act together.. Every new bev has issues. I think 22 or newer will be the best of the bunch. Just too much new tech that needs time to mature."
Interesting how FSD is on nearly every con list for a Tesla but in almost every case the writer has never purchased or subscribed to it…
Not sure where you live. I’m in Chicago. I don’t think you’d like you car without a heater…….
"Is there a good forum or usergroup to get more long term feedback on these cars? Hesitate to ask for users that moved away from these specifically, but seems like that gets the type of underlying details that interest me most, people that are not overlooking day to day usability, and small details that are perpetually buggy excusing them for underlying infatuation with other details of the package."
I love reading this balanced assessment that provides credit and discredit where you think its due. And very interesting to read of the climate control issues.
"Sucks that you got a lemon, but Im glad you were able to appreciate the good parts despite the rare instance of an *extremely* bad part."
Pretty sure youre bad far outweigh the good
"Thank you, for beeing honest."
"Would you consider posting this on /r/TeslaMotors? It seems pretty fair, I think it would be welcomed. A lot of those users make the same complaints."
Add wipers to bad or ugly or wtf
I love how all the Elon fetishists immediately started hating him once it became trendy. I guess I was *avant garde*
"Thats just a reminder that ""Dirty Mike and the boys"" had a good time in there last night!"
"Got yourself an "" I cant afford this car starter pack"""
You bought it and didnt open up the compartments? Was there 5lbs of heroin in the trunk too? Post is hella sus
"Hey, my stuff! Give it back!1!!"
Op got a sampler party pack
At least they used condoms
The guy was smoking grass and tappin ass
Who the fuck smokes meth in a tesla?
"Ass, cash, or grass - looks like he had all 3."
"BTW, those are individual baggies under the scale (a bit hard to see)."
I see a meth pipe and a blue pill. Also what looks like weed particles maybe
Based
Throw the broken meth pipe and condoms keep the scale and the lighter
Charlie sheens Tesla
"Y, just Y."
Well we see what he had to sell it
Whoa cool! They smoke rocks and fuck!
I’m not sure what’s crazier. This or the post I just saw over at r/Audi with the Glock in the loaner.
free downer! dibs!
I like to party
Thats methed up!
"I seem to be (happily) living under a rock. Despite the copious amounts of time wasted/spend on the internet. I just see trash, but somehow I think theres more to this junk?"
That is fucked up. No way would I take ownership of that car.
What the fuck.
"Whatever you paid for that car, it was too much. Youre never going to get the crack residue out, and good forbid you ever encounter a drug-sniffing dog."
Time for calls on Tesla
"Weed is legal, nothing will happen from that (aside from smell) but that little pill there is concerning. Regardless if a vehicle is being sold to another person it should be clean in and out irrespective of the vehicle’s overall condition. Bad look on the seller’s side."
"Tell me you bought a car without looking at it first, without telling me you didnt look at it first."
🤦
JACKPOT!!!!!!
[removed]
Is that the “pussy magnet”?
Tell me you want to show off what drugs you do without telling me what drugs you do.
Crack pipe fellas. Clearly.
"non-lubed too, rough."
Dude’s living one hell of a life.
The flower and scales are for baking don’t worry about it

You sd Tesla but those are some Nissan Altima contents.
Score !!!
At least they considered safe sex +1
Lmaoo bro where did you buy this car FaceBook marketplace?
Bet it was a repo.
Normal traffic stop and the nice police dog alerts all over the car…
Burn the car
Free digital scale. Nice.
This reminds me of a Two and a half men episode. Bet youll be hearing a noise that nobody else can unless theyre in your head
The dude who owned this probably hit the biggest bong rip known to man
I should do this when I sell my car for fuck-fucks
I guess that explains the kind of person who buys a Tesla and immediately sells it within a year.
Take the blue pill
You def got the car for a steal
Forever unclean!
Diabetes?
"Sweet, free cough drops!"
"Nah fuck that. Haha. Im sorry that they didnt even clean their shit up. Thats disgusting honestly. Im in recovery from drug addiction and I just had to clean some shit like that out of my room. I felt gross, I had gloves on an sprayed everything down with antibacterial spray. Its just nasty an lazy as hell. I had left that shit there cause it was triggering me but on a car you sold wtf."
This car has seen some shit.
"100% a pizzachef, you can see how careful he is with his oregano"
"I’d notify the non emergency police line, have it documented, and ask them to take the pipe and to possibly have a dog check it. It’s just a pipe and scale but it would be my luck that I’d get pulled over and the dog come out when I stick to my rights by refusing a search… then they manage to find more drugs that I wasn’t aware of."
You should be checking for “secret” compartments and at least the front and rear bumpers. You may find an investment portfolio in it.
"A scale, lighter, green crumbs, condoms. Its just weed people 😂 someone was having a great time."
Its was driven by hunter Biden ?
Guy likes to party
Did Hunter Biden own this previously lol
They must be fun at parties
"They come from the factory like that, standard equipment. 🥳"
Previous owner was fuckin BALLIN
it is the crackpipe for me
Should have got a free blunt for your troubles..
Wtf am I doing wrong in my life? What is this saying I gotta do drugs to get a Tesla?
"I would go back to the dealership and demand they pay for the car to be searched by drug dogs. On their dime. I’m dead serious. Who knows what is stashed in that car. Just the residue on that pipe is enough to get you in trouble in some states, let alone crossing a border. Ask the general manager to cross a border in that car and smile."
I have that same scale
Sweet! Free lozenges!
"Was that from Carvana? I know some people live that way, but it looks so ridiculous that it looks done on purpose. Looks like someone grabbed trash from an alleyway and put it in there."
 Bet that car has been rode hard and put up wet.
How in the shit did somebody manage to invent a car that a dealer _cant_ clean before resale.
Wow you’re retarded
Target demographic
That was Elons own one.
Dirty mikes car?
Well it’s yours now
Score! Who doesn’t want a sugar skull lighter?!
"What I would do is take that shit to a detailer. Talk to the cops to remove this shit (it could be for weed, which is whatever, but it could be for crack or meth or lord only knows) then take it to detailer. Edit: definitely meth You got yourself a methsla"
At least they wrapped it
So whats your point?
Finders keepers ayeee?
Enjoy it is a great ride.
"Congrats, sick car"
"My understanding is that the 20 inch rims actually gives you less range than the 19 inch rims. Did you get these rims specifically for range? If so, you have gone in the wrong direction.  Do the sensors work? I had heard that they will be if not already disabled with software so sensors or not, smart summon wont work until they fix Tesla vision. Do your sensors still work?"
Welcome to the Tesla club! Congrats!
Congrats! Do you notice any additional cameras in the front headlights or on the side repeaters?
I’ll be buying a Plaid this year and trading up from my 2018 X.
"Congratulations, it’s a fun car to drive. I had a shop wrap paint protection film on my X. Might be a good idea if you want to limit rock damage"
Did you get the yoke or normal steering wheel? Does your back screen have the thin bezels? How long from order to delivery? I’m thinking about ordering.
I’ve wanted one but don’t make enough I’d love to know what everyone does for a living tbh
$3600 to charge it over three years and $3000 in wheels and tires. That’s about all you need to know.
20 minute video for what couldve been a 3-paragraph blog post. Not everything has to be a goddam youtube upload.
"While I don’t own a Tesla, I recently purchased an ID4 awd pro s with a car note of $880. I drive a lot for work and errands so I was spending about $475 ($425 but I paid $50 extra) on a 2019 Tiguan SEL 4motion car note. Then I was spending about another $500- $550 on gas. I used to have geico but my payment was going to be ~$220. With progressive it is $110. So depending on the situation, there is room to save with an EV especially with Volkswagen who offers 3 years of EA charging. This also doesn’t include the state rebate-$4k and federal tax credit $7500 that I get on top of it all."
"If total cost of ownership is the main criteria, a 25k car would be way way way way better. Expensive cars are generally pretty poor for peoples long term financial health."
"I wish he had said what his electricity charging plan is at home and if he had a time-of-use plan. For my area, if you were on a time-of-use plan, you get extremely low or even free electricity at night, but you pay for it with more expensive rates during peak times. I can get a plan thats completely free from 8pm to 6am, but its nearly three times as expensive per kwh when not between 8pm and 6am. TOU plan was $0.26 per kwh when not free and the flat plan is $0.09 all the time. I dont have an EV yet, but I did that calculation to see how much switching to EV and a TOU plan would be for me. It ends up that TOU would cost more money overall even if I had an EV charging at night. TOU plan wins only when I estimated 2 EV charging at night."
"The comparison between a civic and this mp3 is kinda silly. Dont really think people cross shop this trim of a Tesla with a fairly basic civic. No performance style car will be cheaper to maintain than an economy class vehicle but when compared to an ICE sports car, a performance ev will end up being cheaper to run."
"Who is in the market that has the budget for model 3 that is otherwise shopping for a civic? This is not a realistic scenario. If you have a budget for model 3, you are shopping for BMW, Audi, Lexus etc."
I tried to explain this to some people that operating an EV still costs some money. Especially with tires on Teslas which chew them up. When I had my Model 3 the tires after 10000km were noticeably used even with a rotation at 5k. Then if you are using public charging more often vs home charging. 3600$ over 3 years Vs the gas cost would be an savings but the Tesla has a higher purchase price. Comparing to a Civic is really stupid. You should be comparing to a mid range 3er or C class or A4. How I made money with my Tesla was selling it the moment I ordered my i4 and made a 10k profit
"Hybrid civic would’ve saved him much more. Every single one of these test don’t including the MSRP of the car As soon as you add the MSRP the savings are gone.. the tesla ends up being more expensive. Quick math Msrp Toyota Camry hybrid is $28,080 fuel tank capacity of 13.2 gallons, MPG 51 city and 53 hwy. a full tank has a range of 663miles. It’s also much bigger car, midsize Msrp tesla model 3 LR dual motor $55,990 with a range of 358miles. 82kwh battery. It’s a compact car. Small car. I Will use 250miles as are anticipated mileage per day. To achieve 250miles it will take 60kwh for the M3LR, (this is a rough estimate) if you do strictly supercharger, the cheapest rate in my area is $0.17 a kw, it will cost tesla $10.20 To achieve 250miles in a Toyota Camry hybrid, 5 gallons. Of Gas, in my area it’s $2.90 it will cost $14.50 to achieve 250 miles. Tesla on average consumes tires fairly quickly, with all the information I found, it will be safe to assume at 30,000 miles you will need 4 new tires at a cost of $1,300 average. Alignment not factor in. Toyota Camry tires with information I found on average will last 60,000 miles let’s be fair and say it cost $1,300 the same as tesla. To travel 60,000 miles on a tesla would’ve cost $2,570.4 plus 2 sets of tires $1,300 for a total $5,170.4. Now add the MSRP of the car for a grand total $61,160.4 Toyota Camry 60,000 miles $3,654.0 and 1 set of tires, $1300, for a total of $4,954. Add the MSRP, for a grand total $33,034. Not including the time spent charging the vehicle, it’s costing you more time and money driving a tesla on average"
YOULL NEVER GUESS THIS ONE WEIRD TRICK (#3 IS INSANE) TRY NOT TO SCREAM
"Well this is one persons experience. I have owned an Audi e-tron for 3 years , 40,000 miles and not once have I paid for the charging. Now, its not a typical experience but there are plenty of free charging options that people can explore. I also paid 0$ for any maintenance, although I may have needed tires in 10,000K."
"New cars in general have gotten incredibly expensive. If you want to really save money, dont buy a new, buy used."
I just replaced my original tires after 43k miles… must really be drag racing at traffic lights.
Burn this post and title.
"I drive 30,000 miles a year and when I got my model 3 I paid $45,000. I put new tires every 35,000 miles which were about $600. I’ve paid less than $1500 in electricity over 60,000 miles now, .06kwh for my home charging. So if I keep the car for 6 years it will still cost less than my VW GTI I traded in for it. Also it will kill mustangs from light to light all day long with five people in the car. I didn’t buy the car to save money I bought the car to drive a lot of miles on it and have fun with it when I want to."
Clickbait
"Buy a Tesla, you will have a better looking car, technology and better girls"
"Someone else mentioned it in a comment below, but wheres the cost of insurance for those 3 years?"
Not a great article.
"Really wanted an EV last year, but now realize my 16 year old ok car is mega cheaper. Plus 100% of my gas is paid for by someone else."
The argument I always hear about EVs is batteries. Is it really an issue? Would I have to be concerned about replacing the batteries after 5 years? 10? How much would that cost?
Including the upgraded rims in real world cost of ownership is fucking stupid.
It’s amazing how much hate the none Tesla Eva world has for Tesla and Tesla owners
“Is this normal?”
That panel is held in with push rivets. You will find that Tesla fails to put them everywhere. There may have only been one in that location where there should be a few.
"Its the built in braking spoiler. If regen is limited it will deploy, though youll have to manually refit it with duct tape. A roll should be provided with every new delivery but if you find its missing contact your local service centre."
"Sorry that it happened but it is completely normal. Tesla, as every other radioactive car, semi-disintegrates once every 10 days."
I’ve heard of the rear bumper and the old fiber board bottom trays getting torn off when you drive through standing water but haven’t heard or seen any case about the new plastic trays until now. My hypothesis is it was fasten down incorrectly. One bolt likely in the corner came out. Whole panel dipped down and acted like a scoop and a combination between the air and water ripped it apart.
"No, this is not normal, but its not Teslas fault. As evidenced in the Twitter Files, this problem is due to the former Twitter leadership conspiring with the Biden administration, the FBI, trans people, and the coronavirus to hide the truth about Hunter Bidens laptop wiener."
Probably broken by scooping up a ton of water but yes it’s completely normal unfortunately just another Tesla feature (within spec) some people have reported tons of dirt getting stuck up in those panels as well.
“is this normal?” oh sweet child
Yes. Welcome to the world of being MUSKED!^TM
It rained so yea it will fall apart
"You see, seeing posts like this constantly being uploaded on the internet makes me thankful that I never got a Tesla."
Thats 10 more days than I had with mine before being on the side of the road..
Tesla have horrible quality control.
"""Is this normal?"" For a Tesla to begin to fall apart after the first couple of weeks?... Yes."
"For any other brand, no. For a Tesla? Sadly jep."
"""Those are speed flaps."""
"…is this normal? Listen to yourself, man."
For Tesla? Yes this is normal and is a feature. Def not a defect.
"For a Tesla, this is 100% normal. It’s the Elon scam. Pay a lot of money for a heaping hunk of trash."
The car telling you it needs upgraded skid plates. 😁
Just download a software update bro
I cannot imagine buying a Tesla given the tremendous body of evidence suggesting that their vehicles are poorly made (not to mention made by an exploited workforce). How anyone is still supporting Elon Musk in any way is totally baffling to me and I cannot wrap my mind around it.
"No, it’s not normal. Oh wait, it’s a Tesla? Totally normal. Expected even."
Bro so mad it couldn’t even wait for it to stop raining to take the picture. In what world would you expect paneling to fall off on a car that’s brand new
My kid wants me to get a Tesla and then give it to him when he’s old enough… Not gonna do it
Just the beginning. Your car will continue to leave pieces of itself along the way.
"My fingers would fall off if I tried to copy/paste every result out there.     (it isnt just the undermat that has issues, bumpers rip off too, and fascias) "
Yes
Did you not see all the videos on YouTube where the bumpers fall off?
It is normal for a Tesla
For a tesla… yes.
Be glad it wasn´t the steering wheel or roof that came off. Within Spec.
i have the same problem too and tesla delaership wont do it and i try to request tesla insurance tow they told me is not covered and provided me a list of preferred bodyshop and Tesla dealership wont fix it for u
"As a former Tesla owner, I can confirm how shoddy assembly is. Just dumb little things like this or the door not shutting and all kinds of goofy shit. They need to improve their quality control."
Yeah. Totally normal. It is within specs!
Yes bro it’s totally normal to drag part of the car along the pavement while you’re driving.
u/Senior_Function_3746 There are a few rules to owning a Tesla: 1) Never get your EV wet 2) Never feed it after midnight I named mine Gizmo!
"Actually a feature of many teslas, to fall apart due to initial quality"
i would be pissed if i pay 60K on a car and this crap happens.
"Ah yes, Tesla build quality... So exemplary."
"Tesla is one of the worst “luxury” car - very over rated. If you are used to BMW and Audi, you know what luxury feels. For the same price, I can find way better car. Only reason I bought mine was because I wanted to try an EV and Tesla seemed like a good one. This is going to be my last Tesla. Flimsy as hell. Interior is cheap. Over time, you will notice many parts come out. Except for the car seats, everything else is cheaply made. I love the acceleration, but other than that and the car seats, you are driving a cheap car. No wonder, Tesla’s margins are so high. I owned a ton of Tesla stock and after I bought the car, I closed half my position in Jan of last year in around $1200 range (so glad). The hype will fade as the luxury car makers launch their EV collection and Tesla will see a huge demand crush in 3-4 yrs. Tesla will be forced to bring its price down to compete and soon margin will be crushed. Tesla’s PE will be crushed as a result. I want one more Tesla stock pump in the next year, so that I can dump my remaining stocks and say good bye to this overrated overpriced car!! Save this post! Can’t come back to it late 2015, and I know I will be right."
Really. Is this normal? Good grief NO it not normal
Absolutely normal for a Tesla. They are the worst of tge worst when it comes to assembly. Some company specializes in rebuilding Tesla cars as soon as they are out of the factory and tgey are quite busy. 😂
Man same thing happened to me last night. SMH
Welcome to Tesla......
"Tesla - It’s not just good, it’s good enough! (I think that was from the Simpsons?)"
"Its a feature, not a bug."
Hmm I wonder if its normal
Totaled
"Oh yeah, totally normal. Any car I’ve ever owned has started to fall apart in the first two weeks of ownership. Within spec. /s"
"Yes, The push pins are put in manually by people who have to do two cars in about 5 minutes. Leads to defects like this or missed pins which could have caused the failure of your splash guard. My condolences and if you truly care about the safety of your family I request that you replace this vehically ASAP.  In addendum, Lost my father last year while he was harassed at his factory making these cars. Navy veteran, teaching his co-workers skills to help them get promotions and was harassed by some 20-year-old lackey until he eventually succumbed to a heart attack at the age of 47. Happy New Year."
Happens why you run over something….
Totally normal.
"For a car company with quality control no, for Tesla, absolutely."
Is it true that the quality has been slipping?
"Yes, it’s normal - Tesla is gradually implementing the FSD tech, also known as Full Self Disassembling. Jokes aside, Tesla’s QC has always been bad and there are many reports of missing or poorly tightened screws"
"Yeah, thats kinda how they work, it gets ""assembled"" and sent to you with the highest quality Elon can assure, which means itll keep falling apart."
Normal No. But from a tesla you better be lucky thats the only issue from the factory
For all teslas? Yes poor/fast build quality.
It’s normal
Super normal per qElmo.
Normal for tesla. Wait for more
"It’s normal for a Tesla, yes"
"A Tesla having quality issues as soon as it leaves the lot. Yes, that is pretty normal."
Yes it’s normal.
American car quality is low.
Quarter end car!
Don’t worry normal Tesla QC!
Thats actually NOT normal. Usually more comes off and sometimes completely detaches itself. Weird. This one is defective.
"Its a tesla, so of course that is normal. Lots of silly people keep denying they overpaid for junk."
Thats what you get for driving it in the rain!
Suck it up buttercup. You should be thanking him. The man is a genius. Take your woke agenda somewhere else... like Twitter and see how long you last.
How fast did you hit the standing water? When we know that we can tell if it’s normal.
Definitely not normal. Book an appointment with your local SC using the Tesla app. Sorry this happened to you 😢
This picture is fake never happens on a 60000 car
😂
Happens to other manufacturers all the time 🙄🙄
What is wrong with people? Plastic dragging on the road and is this normal. No that is not.
"You in the Bay Area? Guarantee you drove too hard over some water at some point and the pressure caused this piece to be ripped off. But hey, it’s all Tesla’s fault in this sub"
"for those who cant see it... OP hit something. Thats what this is. you ran over a Bump, chunk of wood, Rock, Alligator in the road, but you hit.....SOMETHING. On [pic 1]( its VERY clear that bolt on the right was pulled and its support bracket bent that doesnt just ""Happen"" with the loss of the shrouds. they will drag or fall but wont damage the bracket. you hit something, no fault of the car here."
"Appears to be ABS plastic (or similar), which is much better than the fiberboard they use (or did) on Model 3. Those would detach regularly, sometimes acting as a snowplow. They also had a forward-facing seam, which made a great scoop-mode. Owners would drill holes to attach a metal support to secure that end and keep it from dropping and scooping. First Ive read of a problem in years, so likely all Model 3 now have a similar design. Appears a competent design now from the photos and perhaps the assemblers just didnt clip it in correctly, or the driver went thru a deep puddle or high-sided on snow to break it loose."
[deleted]
Just like pretty much every other car made now. It’s a plastic skid plate held in by plastic clips. All it takes is a big puddle or pile of snow to break the plastic. You can see in one of the pics a cracked between the hole and edge. Which means it got pulled by something and cracked. I see it all the time on many different cars across multiple manufacturers.
Within spec
"lol is this normal? yeah, dude. completely within spec"
“Within Tesla standards”
Nope. Not normal at all for most manufacturers. This is bad even by Teslas own abysmally low standards.
"This is safety feature. Revolutionary invention that will make you louder, so other people will be able to hear you."
Yes. Tesla fun ruining is normal. It detects kids in the car and starts ejecting parts. What’s with this absurd question of course it’s not normal. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Welcome to Tesla.
"It’s abnormal, but it’s normal for teslas to fail abnormally. So the car is acting normally abnormal, yknow?"
Completely normal. Just continue driving over obstacles in the road.
Well at least his lower control arms are still intact for now
Parts falling off a car is never normal unless you have intentionally jettisoned them.
"Question is, is that standard or u payed extra for that ."
"Abysmal build quality is normal, yes."
Not normal
"happened to me driving through standing water too fast, but was not this particular piece of plastic."
Yours is plastic? Lucky.
"yes, welcome to Tesla"

"I know other car manufacturers have had to issue recalls, had major manufacturing mistakes, etc., but the rate of this sort of thing happening with Tesla seems very high by comparison"
duct tape it - tesla service.
At Tesla quality is job 1 well maybe not
This normal Tesla is it in the room with us now
"Wait. Some kids, or your kids?"
Will cost around $500
*Welcome* sir/madame
Yes normal.
Please let Elon know on Twitter. I would post pics for him to see. I dont expect anything to happen to my brand new car. This is terrible.
It’s super normal for trim to fall off expensive new vehicles for no reason. They just tie them all together with rope at the factory
My guess is you drove through a big puddle and I’m broke the fixture.
"Tesla, built like Elon’s grasp of how social media works. Very weak."
Yes
Its normal for a product from an Elon Musk company.
"I love my car, but is this normal? Fixed. He should wait for the new update."
The problem is that you bought Tesla.
Yeah. That’s normal. Just keep driving. It will fix itself with a OTA update.
Totally normal.
Not normal. Clips are probably missing from the factory.
"Excess stuff falls off all the time. It is part of the clever weigh reduction plan. If something falls off and your car keeps going, then everything is fine. Each time this successful operation is performed, you will experience an unsignificant increase in range."
"Before taking possession of a Tesla, you might want to kick the tires."
The Steering Wheel subscription trial ended.
"I got a good car idea, how about a steering wheel that does not fall off while you are driving. It’s a good idea and I stand by it"
They just need to be more hardcore.
More hilarious was the fact that the guys tweet about it seemed to have been scrubbed from Twitters search. (  )
I need a good steering wheel that doesn’t whiff off while I’m driving!
It’s not supposed to fall off?
Shoulda bought used. Built in quality testing.
So serious question… Does this happen with any other car brand? Even a few times a year? I have never heard of it. Ever. Am I hearing it here because it’s cool to shit on Tesla but it’s really the same as all other brands? Or is it really that unique?
"Dont worry, it has Full Self Driving."
"On the freeway? Holy shit, that is terrifying."
"My father just received delivery of his new Model 3. He got home and opened the trunk. Upon closing it, it failed to close. There is more than a 1cm gap on the left side of the trunk. Unreal. QC at Tesla is long gone! "
"Well, at least his front didnt fall off."
"They might need to iron out their ""full self driving"" activation experience."
Someone forgot to pay the steering wheel subscription.
"Looks like Elon Musk delivered a Tesla with a built-in obsolescence feature, it only lasted a week before falling apart."
"[5 Teslas all crashed at the same spot,]( maybe the technology could use some quality control too."
"As employees, you get punished for try to make sure everything is correct, or even close to it. This is the result, people quit caring, customers pay the price"
Did he forget to pay for the steering wheel addon? His free trial must’ve ran out. /s
Lol tesla is only a luxury vehicle on the price point. Less than saab level quality.
"Well Tesla chat support seems smart, in the article they sent a message ""could of"" instead of could have. Big brains at Tesla for sure!"
"It didnt fall off, now that Elon has married himself to the right-wing narrative it was just Jesus taking the wheel."
"Ive had tons and tons of problems in my 30 years of driving across various cars, many of them used and abused beyond what should have been expected. A steering wheel coming off hasnt been one of them."
"Im not a car guy, but I remember a few years ago that everyones raving about Tesla being the best built cars and for defying the saying that American cars are trash. Was that always unfounded or did they become crappy?"
You can deliver a lot of cars and make a lot of profit if you give something up. Like quality.
Straight up my coworker came home with a brand new model y last week. He had to take it in the next day because a warning about his airbag came on and they had to replace the whole airbag unit.
But at least twitter is better now… right?? Right???

Most major manufacturers log the torque values of almost every single nut and bolt on your car. Especially if they are safety critical items. This has been standard practice in the industry for many years.
Software will fix this
"> In this latest occurrence, says he lost faith in Tesla and wants a full refund for the car, which is understandable, seeing how Tesla Service initially charged him $103.96 for the repair, but then backtracked and removed the charge from his invoice. In their attempt to gain a $103.96, Tesla lost the sale of the entire fucking car. Good work."
Doesnt add up. [ Twitter account is from 2015 but no other tweets than these. Doesnt necessarily mean anything by itself. Also seems odd the broken english coming from the Tesla side as well. Seems as if same person wrote both sides.
"For context. From the article; Now, it’s worth mentioning that Tesla isn’t the only manufacturer out there to experience such problems, although it seems Tesla owners are much more vocal about both the features and the defects of their cars. In the past, Ford and Hyundai have issued recalls for a design problem where the bolt that fixes the steering wheel in place was too short and could become loose, resulting in the steering wheel falling off."
"""Go, Go Gadget Steering wheel"""
"I may be crazy, but I think there really is a market out there for the major car manufacturers to each put out one model that has no major electronics and digital displays. The vehicles have engines, etc similar to cars from the 70s and 80s that can be maintained by an average individual with just a little training. Of course, that isnt what they want, so it wont happen."
Yknow im starting to think this elon musk fella isnt that good at running a company
"Ive been driving a 2018 Model 3 for around two years, I do like the actual car a lot and havent had quality issues like this at all. However, Im getting out of it and selling it or trading it in at some point this year. From what I understand, issues like this are far more common in 2020 and up models. In theory, if I traded to a new Tesla, I would have it under warranty and could have any issues fixed. But the nearest dealer is a two hour drive away from me, and I keep hearing horror stories of them holding cars hostage for months while they either have to wait on parts or have a ton of other cars in the queue. Given that newer year models are notorious for crazy issues like this, Im not in a mood to take that gamble. Tesla (and their disciple fanboys) would like to have everyone believe that they are a mature EV manufacturer. In many ways theyre right because the software, charging network, and other things are way ahead of any other company. But in many other ways, theyve got a lot to work on and have even taken steps back in recent years. Ill go back to an EV at some point if Tesla ever improves (and boots Elon out), or Ill wait for other companies to improve their product. EVs are almost there, but not 100% just yet."
This subreddit is so repetitive now
"Hey man, if youre only willing to pay $50-60k for the plebe Tesla, thats what you get! (says every Musk robot on fuck-you-I-got-mine libertarian ""finance"" subs)"
Guy forgot to pay his $8/mo That being said Im not surprised that the steering wheel fell off. Im most surprised that he got it fixed in any reasonable amount of time.
im so glad theres finally competition for EVs
"Its an American car, what do you expect."
So you can hand it to the Boy Wonder next to you to continue driving.
"For me the Ipad stapled to the dashboard is a dealbreaker alone, do people seriously like it?? have decades of design philosophy of using tactile and analogue controls in a car so you can use them fluidly without looking been instantaneously forgotten ?"
So they cut crucial expenses in order to show greater profits last Q. Makes sense.
I have yet to see a Tesla with body lines that line up. Overpriced turds
High tech piece of junk.
I hate to say it but a lot of these QC issues are things that would be caught by a dealer and rectified before delivery with other car manufacturers.
"I thought it was known by now that Teslas are cheap, disposable crap. The reason they can undercut everyone on EVs is that other than the batteries and motor, the car is built with the cheapest parts/ materials available... elon has even said this (in so many words), he has a first principle approach to solving problems and this was the solution he came up with for cheap EV."
Sounds like someone’s been fudging the PPAP or just not bothering.
Newsflash: they are shit cars. The best part about Tesla is that the modicum of success theyve enjoyed has been enough to finally spur traditional automakers to actually push development of their own electrics.
Teslas are such a joke of a car lol
Even better was the car being dropped off at the tesla service center and they message the owner to ask why the car (with no steering wheel) is in for service. What the...
Holy mother of circlejerk.
"From the article: >It’s worth mentioning that Tesla isn’t the only manufacturer out there to experience such problems, although it seems Tesla owners are much more vocal about both the features and the defects of their cars. In the past, Ford and Hyundai have issued recalls for a design problem where the bolt that fixes the steering wheel in place was too short and could become loose, resulting in the steering wheel falling off"
"I used to work in engine component manufacturing for the auto industry. Any significant identified defects a real OEM identifies (we supplied the Big 3, VW, Hyundai/Kia) will turn your world upside down. Anything *safety* related like your damn steering wheel falling off brings some next level shit into your life as it triggers potential criminal penalties for lack of disclosure all the way up the supply chain and such. For any real car company I would say that theres no way they would not have done a comprehensive root cause analysis, quarantine, inspection and/or recall. Then theres Tesla and who knows how they handle it... GM paid almost $3B in damage and settlements for its ignition switch issue which is only somewhat related to safety, as opposed to Firestone tire explosions and rollovers, or a damn steering wheel falling off."
"My 13 year old Toyota doesn’t have power windows or locks, it can’t make silly billy noises when it accelerates, it doesn’t have video games and a TV in the dash, and it burns old dinosaurs for fuel. But it can start just fine in a parking garage, isn’t likely to spontaneously burst into flames, and the steering wheel has never once fallen off."
"What, exactly, are they doing at tesla? Are their cars made by pouring various car-adjacent parts into a big vibrating black box and hoping what comes out will roll forward without immediately bursting into a chemical fire?"
But Elon is so cool and I look so cool in my overpriced hot wheels jeep
Lol this piece of shit of a car shouldnt cost half of what it costs. Top gear initial reaction to tesla is still relevant to this day
Don’t talk about Tesla quality control or how unsafe they are unless you want a bunch fanboys who will die for Tesla and believe they can do no wrong breathing down your neck.
Hope they recall like when Ford had same problem. 
I feel like Tesla is finished. They did well whilst the major manufacturers were still dragging their feet on automation and EVs. But now that the big boys have got in gear Tesla just looks like a joke.
Must be Whistlindiesel. Who else would do that? Edit: yep it is. He drives it upside down. 
someone tell Elon thats not how you get into the Amish maket
Finally a mod I can get behind. I just worry the charging cables might get stuck in the spokes. It’s going to take quite the spokecard to make the motorcycle noise.

It has the turning radius of a steamboat.
This is ironic tho

my one question is how he dose all this shit and airbags dont go off? i thought most cars had rollover sensors that triggered airbags? they seem to know what they are doing though so im guessing the answer to my question is they just disabled them
Thought this was /r/confusing_perspective at first but no it’s literally a tesla with wagon wheels
Could hook a horse up to it and it’d be completely off the grid.
How does this guy get the money to do this level of content? Trashed the Ferrari and ruined the Tesla and the amount of views wouldn’t pay for it?
"That was a very entertaining video. Must have been expensive to make, as even a used Tesla is pretty expensive."
"Rock me, mama"
I’m shocked that the Tesla doesn’t have some type of rollover detection that disables drive functions. I mean it’s upside down!
Ladies and gentlemen we have a winner!
Finally!
"Thing must have an awesome turn radius -- like, 500 meters or something."
Turning this thing must be a bitch.

Hear me out
Is it really a shitty mod if WhistlinDiesel does it and drives the Tesla upside down?
When people say they like the stock M3P 20s
How do the doors open? And how does one get in and out?
I would just like to have money to waste on stupid shit Just.Like.This Lol
We’ve come full circle
Is this in Armish country?
Like 4 Ferris wheels on a Tesla
how do you get out exactly or in for that matter
Someone also did this to a Hellcat I believe
How do you get in?
wasnt this upside down yesterday?
So that’s how the Amish roll?
The reason whistlindiesel on YouTube did it is so they could drive a tesla upside down.

Good luck with turning...
I ask wheel questions now. How get in? How get out?
I thought that was crappy Photoshop...then I saw the video
And the best part is that you literally can’t go sharp turns because then you would absolutely ram the wheels against the car.

You could take the engine and windshield out and have it pulled by horses. Teslas for the Amish
You drive over other cars like that. Auto-pilot and shit.

How do you get in?
"One big cause of phantom drain on the Tesla is sentry mode. It keeps the car from sleeping. Had this been turned off, it wouldnt have drained as much and probably would have been more comparables to the Kia. Good write up!"
I don’t understand the comments about charging. There are at least three Tesla superchargers between Denver airport and Colorado Springs and about five or six to Moab. You would just need to enter your final destinations and the car tells you where to charge and how long.
"> I never quite got the break-shift-cardkey-tap order quite right. The easiest thing to do is just stick the cardkey in the cupholder right when you get in. Then treat the brake pedal the same as the ""ON"" button or key-turn in modern gassers. Then you can put it into gear. I discovered the ""keycard in the cup holder"" trick myself today, after 4 years of Model 3 ownership, as Im also renting a Model 3 at the moment. I just sold my old one, and Im taking delivery of a new Model Y next week. > Charging at my sisters house didnt work (it didnt like the length of the extension cord or something). Quite likely the extension cord wasnt low enough gauge wire. I believe you need at *most* 12-gauge to charge an EV, since its a continuous 12A draw. Most home appliances dont draw anywhere near that much, so companies get away with making most extension cables 14-gauge or higher. > having to map out my travel to ensure I get all the charging stations seemed like a real pain.... Teslas will actually do this for you. Just put in your destination, and if you have to charge on the way, itll tell you where and how long to do so. That said, if youre not able to charge while *at* the destination, youll want to put your destination in as just a waypoint, then tell the car to navigate back to where you started, so that itll suggest appropriate charging for the entire round trip. > I wanted to like autopilot (beyond the visualizations which was really cool), but I just couldnt trust it. It took me several days to fully trust it, back when I got mine in 2018, so I dont blame you here. Its definitely an ""acquired taste""."
"Range anxiety goes away pretty fast once you have an electric car. You get to know where the chargers are, you know how much the car consumes electricity and you plan accordingly. Do not let that stop you from buying an electric. I am not a Tesla fan, but I got to say that they really nailed the charging since they own the chargers and the car plans the trip for you. Very convenient."
"Yeah, the Hyundai/Kias that are based on ICE models are boring. Which is exactly what some people (my dad) want. The EGMP-platform models (Ioniq 5, EV6,) are far more on par with Tesla on the tech front."
"Just want to note, my dad complained about my Tesla using the key card before I set his phone up. He said it was a night and day difference for him. The frunk does feel way too delicate in my opinion. I have a 2018 so I can’t speak to any changes they made but I feel like I could easily break my frunk if I got angry enough."
The hood is aluminium on the tesla. its meant to be light. Most of the stuff int he tesla you setup once on your driver profile and forget about it. such an easy car to live with day to day. Esp if you are changing drivers
"The rental experience on a Tesla is subpar without app access. If you have the app, it eliminates use of the keycard. I keep mine in my wallet for emergencies, but have never actually needed it. Sentry mode uses about 100w continuously. If you are on a trip without good charging options, you probably want to turn it off. You were probably using a 16ga extension cord, you need at least a 12ga cord to charge a car. The car stopped charging to prevent a fire. Use the built-in navigation to plan your charging stops, it is very good at calculating your range, and how much energy you need. Voice command is extremely useful for most of the commonly used controls, including music, climate, wipers, phone, and navigation."
Interesting experience. My first EV experience was with the prior generation Niro - a 2021. I took it overnight from Los Angeles to San Diego and back. It was nice and your analogy of a car that happens to be electric is spot on. I hope Hyundai/Kia quality has improved over the years.
"If you owned the car, you’d adjust the side mirrors once and be done - the settings (along with seat & steering positions) are saved to the driver profile. Having physical buttons or prominently accessible on screen controls for mirror adjustments would be unnecessary clutter and distracting."
It took me a very long time to get used to the undersized side mirrors on the Tesla. And that was coming from a much smaller car. It’s something that surprises me that more people don’t talk about.
"Ive owned a Tesla for almost 6 years now, and I could not agree more about the UI being unintuitive. Every time a new person gets into my car and wants to change something, I need to explain it to them. Something you didnt seem to need was to change the wiper setup, which is easily the best example of their worst design. Some noises from a parked Tesla are normal- quiet coolant pumps and things like that. You should not hear the HVAC pump or fans going when you get out of the car, though. Somethings wrong with the car you rented, and thats especially true if it had noticeable battery drain over night. As for charging, eventually its exactly the same as driving a gas car around. You learn how fast the car uses battery, and you know where charger locations are. I rarely think about it unless Im on a road trip, and in those situations I just punch my destination into the computer and it figures everything out for me. The same is true on all modern EVs. They plan charging stops and the route for you. Sounds like you jumped right into the fire with EVs. It gets much easier to own and use them over time, and I bet if you had someone explaining how to do things it would have been easier on you getting the Tesla setup the way you like. But for sure it does a lot of things different just to be different."
Tesla might have drained because of Sentry more overnight as well
"I took a trip in my Model 3 from San Jose, CA to Las Vegas. It was fun seeing the same set of Teslas at the charging stations along the way. No concerns getting there at all. Lots of stations. On the way back, we took a trip through Death Valley. Had no problems, but Id be lying if I said I wasnt concerned about range. But that was more about being in the middle of the desert as it was getting close to dark and no cell service with my charge running low. We pulled into the charger with 7% charge left. A bit too close for me out in the middle of nowhere. We werent the only Tesla out there, either. We saw at least two others. The rest of the trip back was fine. It was a memorable trip for sure."
"The UI complaints by OP are non-issues for owners. They’re either things you don’t do at all (key card) or you only do once or very infrequently (mirrors). Even so, the mirrors and steering wheel adjustments are executed well in the UI in my opinion. Also both are on the quick access controls - one press to open the car settings and both are right there. As far as the key card, I haven’t done it in ages but I know you just tap the card on the console and then just…drive. There isn’t any specific sequence needed. Tbh, Im surprised by anyone agreeing the tesla UI is not intuitive. Even my non-tech savvy 78 year old father has no issues, and I just taught him two weeks ago that mobile banking exists. Tesla’s software alone I think is what would keep me from going to other brands currently. The standard infotainment UI/UX of pretty much any other car feels like using a blackberry again to me after Tesla. That extends also to the mobile app. I was in a family member’s new Mercedes recently and the UI is atrocious. Even new it feels outdated."
Thank you for the write-up.
I’ve rented a few teslas and the key card thing is awful. I own a Tesla and the single most enjoyable part of that car is not having a key. Charging can be a disaster. This is not a Tesla issue. Super chargers are awesome. Everything else is anywhere between plug in and walk away to fight with an app for 15 minutes to eventually give up and leave. At this point I could not imagine owning an ev without the ability to charge at home. Maybe only charge at work… that’s not going to work for everyone. But to rely on public chargers is not a viable solution.
"I just took delivery of my first Tesla, a Model Y, in early. February. The Tesla definitely takes some getting used to, and thats coming from someone who has had a Nissan Leaf since 2015. I completely agree about the ""Autopilot"" being sub-par. Its nowhere near what Musk implies it is. Also, I rented a 2022 Model Y with the ultrasonic sensors, and now I feel like my 2023 is crippled by the lack of them. I have no proximity warnings to go by, as they havent enabled them in the camera-only software suite. Anyhow, I still love the car. It takes a while to get used to its ""Teslaness"" but now that Ive adapted to it, when I get in my wifes 2023 Bolt EUV which arrived at the end of February, it feels old-fashioned and weak. The acceleration in the Tesla is absolutely brutal, and I didnt even spring for the Performance option. That being said, if you want a more ""normal"" EV, the Bolt is the way to go. Its simply the next step in the evolution of the Leaf weve had for 8 years, and most folks will be happier with their initial or short-time experiences in it precisely because its familiar and more intuitive. Im not a Musk or Tesla fanboy (in fact I find Musk embarrassing and I wish he wasnt such a huge part of the Tesla culture) and I try to be fair when I write this stuff. Just wanted to add my perspective having current knowledge of the state of comparable 2023 EVs."
"We have both, 2023 Tesla M3 and 2022 KIA Niro EV. I always preferred to drive SUVs and switching to a Tesla was a big change. The lack of buttons and switches turned me off initially but after a while I got use to it. Tesla is fun to drive. KIA has a traditional feel and it like a utility , nothing exciting but good city driving car."
"Your experience with the Tesla rental sounds like mine, though I never had to charge. I loved how it drove, and very much did not love driving it."
Try renting a Kia ev6 or Hyundai ioniq 5 next time and see how they compare to the Tesla.
I feel like about half of your complaints are operator error. I mean how is you not seeing the gear stalk in a common location a design error? Theres also no car out there that you shift before you unlock/start. Thats what the key card does. Hence the word key.
How old are you?
Thanks for the write up OP.
"I have a Kia Niro EV and the description ”it’s a car that’s electric rather than an electric car” is the perfect description, and the reason I got one. It’s just a car. It gets you from A to B. It’s nothing special, but it does the ”nothing special” really well, IMO. Steady, reliable, reasonably fun to drive. That’s all I need."
"You nailed my impression of Kias in general. Just a car, that is nothing special about it. Local dealer is not special in anyway except their aggression. I can see that renting a Tesla would be frustrating with all the controls. I suspect Tesla could fix this with by programming a simp rental car function option. Mod 3s are addictive."
"I just want EV cars that look/feel like cars. They dont need be be super pedestrian and Id be happy if there was a bit more power. Im very happy more normal OEMs are joining the fray. Im super happy Tesla exists because they got the EV movement going.. but right now some of their design choices and interior choices and quality choices are basically holding the movement hostage until we get more competition, not including the musk effect."
The Tesla rearview mirror is small for a reason. The rear window is small. A bigger mirror would only give you a better view of the back seat and the head rests.
How was the stalk hidden from your view? It is right there on the right behind the wheel. How can you kiss it?
"I sold my Tesla because it’s a gadget first and a car second, the Kia niro is the opposite and I’ve been really pleased with it. Most don’t even know it’s electric until you do the zoom zoom. Edit uh oh I made the Elon stans mad."
Try a rivian!
"""The UI was not nearly as intuitive as I was expecting"" I was impressed the first time when I test drove the car coming from a 2013 fusion but the more I use it since i bought it the less I find it anything less than needlessly complicated and frustrating. ""took some doing and I never quite got the break-shift-cardkey-tap order quite right. "" Once you setup the tesla app on your phone its a breeze. It automatically detects when your near the car, leave the car and inside the car. The key is very annoying honestly wish they made a fob instead."
"I also just rented a Tesla M3 on a trip accross Texas to see if it was worth it given the popularity. I have owned an ev for 5 years now and have just purchased a second one for my partner so my feeling going in were a bit different from yours. Range anxiety was a non issue\*. with some a little advanced planning you know where to stop and charge so its really not a problem. \*with tesla, using the cars nav will tell you when and where to charge along your route to arrive at your destination with at least 10% left. this is great IF your destination has available charging. for my trip, the car would remove charging stops if i drove efficently, however, I would still need to charge since I would not be able to once at the destination (I was visiting with customers and staying at hotels, so no destination or overnight charging). The solution I found was to enter in all the destinations for my trip into the nav at once, making the car think i was going to one right after the other. this forced the car to add in charging stops at locations that made sence. Driving experience and ease of charging were this cars strong points. pleasure to drive, nice acceleration and handling. cabin noise was louder than my car however. Livibility is this cars weak point imho. The door handles are difficult to use unless you have the exact perfect form. trying to open the door with a bag or phone or keys in your hand is a hassle. controling every aspect of the car through the screen is not good. it is menus and setting to change anything from steering wheel position to wiper speed to opening the glove box. does the minimalist asthetic look good - yes. is it practical for everyday life - no. overall I do understand the draw to the M3, it is a good looking car that drives well, is quick and compared to other luxary brands, is good value. however, I will not be buying one as my next EV."
I feel like about half of your complaints are operator error. I mean how is you not seeing the gear stalk in a common location a design error? Theres also no car out there that you shift before you unlock/start. Thats what the key card does. Hence the word key.
Stopped reading after you couldnt get the hang of putting the car in drive.
"A few of the issues associated with the Tesla are just non-owner issues I.e. using the key card. Once you are a owner the phone app is super smooth and just lets you enter/exit/start with no issues. Once you get used to the HVAC controls and UI of the Tesla it’s very intuitive, but take a a few weeks. Also, testing the range of one in a mountain area vs costal area is not really fair, elevation will adversely effect any EV quite a bit."
"You are the first person Ive heard have a difficult time charging with a Tesla. Tesla is the opposite. They are the easiest. Also, you had sentry mode on which is why your battery drained so much overnight. The cameras and sensors were on. Also please state the actual trim next time. Not all tesla model 3s have the same range. You most likely had the standard range one which probably has less range than the kia"
"Oh trust me, we ALL know why you didnt charge the KIA"
I totally agree that Tesla UI is not intuitive
were***
Oh god. Smartphones and EVs arent for everybody I guess 😵‍💫
I feel like you should have rented a tricycle 😂😂
The car charge loss overnight was probably attributable to leaving the sentry turned on so the car didnt sleep and was video recording all night.
"I suppose adjusting the mirrors might be annoying, but if you make an account/profile the setting will be saved. Any tesla you get in afterwards will adjust to your preference. In many ways you only ever have to set it once and youre done ""forever"". The stock, I agree, is probably unintuitive. But Id say that is true of any car if youve never driven one. A quick ""relearning"" and its pretty good. Older large vehicles used to have a stock like this too. Its a little different in how it was activated, point being, its in a different place than modern shifters. In any car Ive ever driven youve had to have your foot on the brake to shift, so its possible Im misunderstanding the issue you had. I do agree about air control. I think they went for aesthetic rather than function here. Ive never had a gripe or issue with manually adjusting them. Gotta say, Im surprised you made no mention of of one pedal driving. That was probably the biggest difference for us."
"The only reason you had to use the key card is because you were renting the car. No one else uses the key cards and its fantastic. Frankly its the one of a few features keeping me with Tesla currently. I dont even have to think about locking or unlocking or remembering to bring a key fob or open my phone app or anything. Just walk up to the car get in a drive and then park and walk away. It really is that simple. You dont have to fiddle with your phone at all like other brands. No pulling up an app, no taping your phone to the door or what ever. No key fobs to carry around."
"the keycard experience is really limited to rentals in actuality... actual owners would use the keycard once in a blue moon... the phone key and the optional fob works great and is a seamless experience from getting in to shifting into drive... keycard is meant as a backup, they should really set up your phone app as a phone key as part of the rental process... yeah current version of autopilot is pretty jarring, early reports of V11 in limited rollout right now is positive and has huge improvements so will wait and see... its good that you didnt do the same long distance trip in the Kia, if you had range anxiety in the tesla, you wouldnt like the current CCS experience at all..."
"Renting a Tesla vs. owning one has a very different. For one is Tesla sending you information with links to new driver experience videos, and you are best prepared at the time you pick up your new car. Most Rental companies that have Teslas do not give you more introduction beyond where to place the card to get into the car, start the car, lock the car. An actual new owner will get in their car and directly be presented with creating a driver profile and the controls of adjusting mirrors and steering wheel. You will also have access to the car in the Tesla App, which makes a lot of things even easier. I would wish Tesla would offer Rental companies a Mode in their App to add the rented car and that the car would always be reset and then synced with your profile through the App. Many new owners are also way too shy using the voice commands to get things going. It’s actually very natural. I guess it is due to legacy cars not having such good software."
Having lived in the Denver metro area for most of my life and taken numerous trip down to Pueblo for track days in my SR+ I am completely baffled as would you wouldnt have topped off for 20 mins at either of the two Superchargers in the Springs? There is also one in Monument. Why would you intentionally avoid one of the major benefits of driving a Tesla? There really isnt much planning. You simply click on any Supercharger station on the map and go.
Sometimes i actually wonder how much people play around with their vents that its an actual concern...
The best solution to range anxiety as a Tesla owner; Switch to % and put in your destination on the GPS. Never worry again
"Falls in line with a lot of what we know about Teslas - the main powertrain is pretty good. But there are a lot of little bits that can and do go wrong with them. When they do it can be a massive pain. Little silly tacking on super expensive tires into the maintenance costs...but whatever, fair to point out most of it because all those lil things add up. EDIT: lol, as soon as this post got big the elon-bots came out in force. pathetic."
"As a BMW owner, I would Love to only pay 5k for 90k miles...."
"My GF has a 2019 Model 3 and Ive honestly been surprised by how many times shes had to take it in or have a technician come out because it seems like every couple of months some little thing here or there is breaking causing errors. Meanwhile, my 2012 civic with 200,000 miles has needed less repair during the last year. I love electric vehicles. But its clear Tesla is still new at manufacturing, and theyve ""over techd"" everything to the point it can break way easier."
"A one-vehicle sample size isnt a reliable source. Hertz has 20,000 Teslas and says [they are 50 pct cheaper to maintain than fossil fuel cars.]("
"Even with the majority of the costs being from tires and windshields (lmao), not even 6k for 90k miles is actually pretty good I would think. Even doing some rough math of saving out on oil changes, 90k miles /5k miles per oil change at $100 per oil change is $1800. Other regular maintenance I could easily see going up to 5-6k on an ICE car. Would like to see how it compares to a similarly priced car in mileage."
"I didnt see it anywhere in the article, but assuming it costs about $0.03 per mile in electricity she spent $2700 in utility bills for 90k miles. Compare that to an ICE car that averages 30mpg at $3.50 per gallon that would be $10500 for the same distance. Her repairs were free when you account for gas savings."
Tires are the biggest expense.
"What a terrible article. He included physical damage as maintenance costs? He hit 6 inches of snow and wonders why the underbody cover needed to be replaced? Then he went into 12 inches of water? WTF? He never explained the alignments. Does he keep hitting curbs or something? I can go 90k miles without needing an alignment. And finally on to tires. He claims that the added weight causes extra wear? No my guy, it does not. You just keep buying cheap tires. A Dodge Scat Pack weighs about the same or more. So in actuality, he only needed 2 repairs that were not normal maintenance. “Replace Superbottle (battery and drive system cooling valve): $672.75 Replace PTC (the cabin heater failure caused the drive system to freeze up): $1,148” These 2 repairs are equal to just the oil changes needed on an ICE vehicle, never mind all the other maintenance needed by 90k miles which would include spark plugs, transmission flushes, engine filters, and whatever fails on a ICE vehicle. Ya, this article is some huge BS."
I havent spent anything on my leaf 50k miles in.
"This has nothing to do with electric vehicles and everything to do with this Model 3 and this persons subjective experience. Furthermore, this has nothing to do with technology and has no reason to be on this subreddit. What a fucking waste of 5 minutes."
The only thing that seemed egregious is the Tires being shit after 30k miles. I have 65k mileage warranties on my tires. And they generally last at least to that and sometimes past. But 30k seems crazy low.
This thread has taught me people don’t know much about tires. High speed tires need to be rated for heat. Weight and EV (low rolling resistance) add to costs. Smallest radius is a 19” so less sidewall is more expensive. 60k mile tires are not better than 30k mile tires. They are different with different drive dynamics for different jobs. Any sports car this will be the same and any car that does 0-60 under 4 seconds may as well be a sports car.
"My F150 which is one of the more reliable cars / trucks I’ve owned at 130,00 miles has had the accelerator body fail, 2 sets of tires, multiple front end alignment issues, o2 sensors went out, vacuum solenoid went out. I’ve probably dropped more on my truck than this Tesla. The repair list sounds like normal repairs for owning a car to 90k miles. After reading that list I’d much rather have an EV for my daily driver. If only they were available and cheaper."
Did anyone read the article? Over half the cost was tires and tire alignment. Same maintenance cost would be on an ice car.
"$5,500 including consumables, half of which were tires replaced 3 times (maybe get better tires if you’re driving that much?) with tread out to 120k seems very reasonable for what is basically a $55,0000 car. That’s like $0.06 per mile. What the heck was ‘expected’?"
"I’ll save you the click. It’s $720 in out of warranty repairs. The rest is tires, alignment and damage (front and rear diffuser—this happens when you drive over something…like when you take a passenger car off-road [see picture above])"
I mean how much of this was from being a bad driver/poor maintenance? Did they do rotations when they should have etc
Sad to say the person an idiot. You rotate the tires more regularly and it’s much cheaper. Which is half the costs. Then they hit stuff for a further 1200. Half of the remaining costs. Plus I assume as he is hit shit all these alignments are his fault as you can also use the digital adjust for alignments. Actual repair number seems more like 2k not 5k.
Buy better higher longevity road wear tires. They cost more but last twice as long and therefore less expensive in the end. Buy from tirerack.com and ship directly to a tire place near you.
Having someone re-attach the steering wheel every 400 miles really adds up.
I have a model Y that I bought in late 2020. Still have the original tires. No issues whatsoever so far. This lady has 90k miles and is complaining about changing tires 3 times. I think that falls in line with most cars. Alignment is maintenance. Not sure about the others but I suspect those are one-off.
"Just came to say, “fuck these Tesla puff pieces”. Tesla isn’t nearly as good as it’s been sold as."
Im surprised that there were so many tire replacements. Im at 33K miles on a Y Performance edition and my tires have tons of tread. I should make 50K to 60K easy. I also have the much softer performance tires.
"Stupid question, could you offset the increased tire wear with better tires, or do most tires wear roughly at the same rate unless you pay a lot more, negating savings?"
"""However, the heavy EV battery causes tires to wear out more quickly than for an ICE vehicle"" Its not weight my dude. Its the instant torque of an EV. There are much heavier vehicles than Teslas that can easily do 30-40k miles between tyre replacements if you use a premium tyre. EVs chew through tyres like nothing, because of the torque. We have a little electric VW e-Up which weighs nothing(around a tonne total), has laughable amount of power(80bhp) and yet it destroys the front tyres purely through torque - you have to be really careful or it happily spins the tyres on anything that isnt perfectly dry tarmac."
She said driving dirt roadingly
"This is cheap prior costs on two of my last subarus i had were way way more over 120k mi, and thats not adjusting for the last three years of inflation. Just brakes on an sti were $3k, 25kmi maintenance was some $1.5k. Boom not even at tires yet lol. This is only at 25kmi on the speedo!. Sti was $42k new. Insurance was way higher too. I had a head gasket blow which warped the head on a Forrester was $5k done by a friend too. Then streering rack $1.5k. Two repairs on that car blow away this “high maintenance”, not including oil tires, gas extra vs electrical."
"n=1, 90k miles on mine, total maintenance costs: 2 sets of tires, of which the last set is still mostly new. Oh, and a few liters of wiper fluid."
EVs need tires designed for them. You absolutely will not get decent wear using tires meant for cars that weigh much less and have much less torque.
"More bullshit, own one and it’s fucking amazingly dumb to hear these stories."
"Why did they need to buy THREE sets of tires? Including the tires that came with it, they went through 3+ sets (theyre on the 4th set now)? in 90k miles?? The bigger issue is that they had to replace or service a lot of stuff that is just shoddy parts etc on Teslas part: ""*9) February 20, 2023/90,029 miles: Remove and replace PTC/cabin heater (car wouldn’t go into drive) = $1,148.00* "" for example. I mean, REALLY?"
No worries. Ill take it off your hands.
"Basically, dont buy a shitla"
"Interesting...I got an S in 2016. About 62k miles (Yeah, not a lot of driving, especially working from home)...Besides eating through tires due to weight, Ive had 1 out of warranty issue. Replacement of 12v battery that was about $300 (year 5, maybe?). Ive heard the QA has gone to shit recently, which would give me pause to buy another without a deep dive inspection before accepting. I had an issue with 1 door handle not extending, but that was under warranty. Battery: Ive lost about 5 miles/year to my ""full charge"" - 256 when I purchased, about 227 last time I fully charged (actual milage is lower, but whatever). I was so use to having my tires rotated every 3k miles with my oil change, Id say my tire rotation (or lack there of) is my issue because I never take the thing in for anything (which is nice) Issues that bug me: Still waiting on 2 recall issues to be resolved. Well, maybe 1? There was a second on my app, but that isnt there anymore (something about a latch, but kept telling me parts werent available and to check back later). The eMMC Recall bugs me. App tells me: ""Diagnostics indicate that the eMMC in your vehicle is healthy."" Its been > 2 years, and they keep saying parts arent available. If you can sell new cars, you can fix your old ones! My screen occasionally goes out, doesnt start up at all, but most often screen starts, but will NOT respond/function for a couple of min. This is an issue because I cant turn on any defrost, close my garage, or do much. I know, first world problems. I still really enjoy driving the car, and I dont see myself replacing it anytime soon."
"70k mile 2018 model 3 owner. The only work Ive had to do is (full set) tire replacement, windshield wipers, and the air filter. Tesla was paid to replace the 12v battery for ($~130) when it started throwing failing battery alarms due to old age, mobile tech did this in 10 minutes. Under warranty, Tesla had to replace the PTC heater, fix something with the charge port, and then do the trunk wiring harness retrofit. They had the car overnight and provided a loaner. Ive saved so much money on gas that this maintenance Ive had to do is beyond free. I dont know why this guy is eating tires. I believe we have the same car (AWD/LR) and mine does not wear like that. The fact that he has needed alignments is concerning, I think hes hitting things and knocking the car out of alignment and wearing the tires wrong."
"Dont worry, Tesla is going to keep discounting."
Why no brake work in 90k? Seems to me that would be significant in cost totals.
"For some comparison, Im at 30,000 miles on a Hyundai Ioniq 5, which is the first kinda serious EV platform from a legacy brand. So far there have been zero... and I mean zero issues barring third party damage caused to the vehicle. I am getting its second set of tyres put on later this week, and it is pretty expensive at about £1000 ($1200) however cheaper options were available, but never skimp on tyres. Others have experienced issues with a 12v battery draining issue, but my understanding is that its code-related, and a fix is in the pipeline."
"I think thats the failing of Tesla, it dragnet for service from dealer type vehicle. its difficult to find mechanic who can actually work on them since parts cant be sourced from Tesla itself, you have find junked Tesla to do it. Dealerships (I worked at one) are more expensive typically for car owners. Warranties certainly fix it costs, but Mom & Pop types are cheaper unless its vehicle whos part are horded. Im not saying small shops are perfect, have no crooked owners sometimes. Its on average. However, Tesla is among worse when it comes getting parts. I do think until EV parts are flowing better, its going be expensive wake up call for EV owners when repairs happen and you end up with a second hand EV."
"Honestly, tesla cars are good as idea but now tesla company needs years and years of development and learning to tune the cars. Because now they look nice from outside and drive e-only, but the build quality is low, ergonomy is very bad, interior design is sad etc. Companies like Ford, Mercedes etc. are dekades of learning in front of tesla and to build a car is one of most problematic things company can face. Maybe in 15 years also tesla’ll be a piece of quality, but now is just how to show off. But - it’s good to have those customers so they earn money for development. - experienced tesla driver"
Cheapest OEM parts other manufacturers wouldnt touch?
"Is her daughter... wearing socks with birkenstocks? Seriously though, she fell for the Elon-con and bought one of his products. It still confuses me that people are still buying Teslas when there are more EV options on the market now anyway."
"2015 Nissan Versa with a 5-speed the cheapest car you can get. I have 170k miles and have only had to change oil and filters and replace a stolen CAT, with tires Im still less than 25k all in and it gets 36 MPG"
Whens the battery due on Teslas?
I know people who haven’t been able to drive their Tesla for over a week because we’ve had wicked ice storms come recently just destroy the power grid. There’s like 2 mobile tech crews around here and when I asked them how busy they are they just laughed. Edit: 2 people are butt hurt over facts. Must be exhausting.
"Like one of these things was EV related. The rest were Tesla quality issues. If youre still buying a Tesla at this point, dont be surprised by the quality issues. The tire issue is a real concern for EVs, but its not that bad. Some ICE cars have the same problem. My Golf GTi eats tires too. Im lucky if I get 30k miles out of them. I think it has more to do with them being low profile than anything."
She said she’s had 10 cars over the years?
"I wonder how much better the newer ones will fair, this seems like an earlier model (an assumption based on chrome trim and the mileage cited, though the latter is less about age and more about usage…). The comparison to a 2021/2023 Model 3 with the same mileage would be interesting."
"The aero shield is certainly self inflicted damage (possibly the wheel alignments, too). Thats not maintenance. According to this study by the AAA the average cost for repair and maintenance of a car is 9.12ct per mile: [ Which would mean that maintenance on a similar ICE car would have come to 8208$ by this point...which is *way* higher than what the article cites. Even if we take just the EV average of 7.46ct per mile it would come out to 6714$. That means (if we deduct the aero shield) that her Model 3 came out at 5014,29$...**read: more than 25%** ***cheaper*** **than what the average EV would cost in maintenance and repairs over a similar mileage.** In light of this: Claiming to be surprised by high cost seems ... weird."
"To be fair, I had a Prius V for 10 years... My costs were basically: \- rotors needed replacing (twice) because the breaks arent used nearly as much as on non-hybrids and I dont slam the damn breaks. \- had to replace tires once \- regular maintenance \- battery died, was a costly replacement ($240) \- someone stole a small plastic part which is a dick move lol \- I got to use my local mechanics who I trust, they never seemed to fuck me over. BASICALLY thats it. There was a costly insurance related repair because someone removed my bumper by crashing into it while the car was parked. Probably total out of pocket cost was $3k So IDK if this is really that bad of a ding vs tesla, maybe $2k more over more miles than I put on... not bad."
Thanks for sharing
"I have 211k miles on mine. It’s been far far lower in cost than a traditional ICE, and more than expected. I’ve spent 3500$ on maintenance, repairs, and upgrades. Not including tires."
"Part of the grift, y’all."
"Okay, so not just Toyota, but all the major Toyota-affiliated parts makers, small parts makers, Japanese universities, newspapers, reverse engineering firms, and even steel mills are tearing apart Tesla and BYD EVs. And you know what? Its no surprise. Theres this hilarious anecdote about Honda buying a Porsche GTS to develop the NSX, and when they took it apart, they found a note of encouragement from the Porsche team to Honda in the engine compartment."
/r cars in shambles
"> Toyota estimates Tesla’s use of structural battery pack and front & rear casting has enabled the EV maker to cut 220 pounds from the weight of the Model Y. In addition, Toyota believes this approach has allowed Tesla to increase the Model Y’s range while at the same time decreasing manufacturing cost."
"Not really hard to believe if you’ve seen tear downs of other Teslas or analysis from Sandy Munros Youtube. Easiest way to put it is that Tesla’s are designed from the ground up to be EVs and don’t share parts with ICEvs so they are very well packaged From what Ive seen, when Tesla engineers see something inefficient, they are allowed to design from scratch to address whatever it is. EVs from other companies are built with different mentalities, with some being as bad as EVs built on ICE platforms using only off-the-shelf parts."
"This isnt terribly shocking. There was a German automaker that bought an original Model S. Tore it apart, and said, ""Well shit, itll take a decade to build a competitor."" Or something to that effect."
"*word of mouth article that’s positive about Tesla* r/cars: I sleep *word of mouth article that shits on Tesla* r/cars: real shit? This falls in line with many of the other teardowns of Teslas, especially after production has been ramped up (while ramping is often quite iffy). Their casting of the rear subframe is an **incredible** thing of engineering and manufacturing. Hate em or love em, they’ve done some novel, very interesting things with EV design and manufacturing."
I dont hate Tesla but articles with no named sources are usually fake news.
So basically I can make up a story about anything and say it was given to me in conditions of anonymity? This is a joke of an article and should be grouped with clickbait ads on sketchy websites.
">A Toyota executive who took part in the Model Y teardown spoke with Automotive News in conditions of anonymity and said about the all-electric crossover “taking the skin off the Model Y, it was truly a work of art. It’s unbelievable.” So no evidence except what a journalist claims?"
It’s kinda crazy it took Toyota this long to do one
">A Toyota executive who took part in the Model Y teardown spoke with Automotive News in conditions of anonymity and said about the all-electric crossover “taking the skin off the Model Y, it was truly a work of art. It’s unbelievable.” So the source for this is someone who writes articles for a website that circlejerks Tesla which conveniently cant be backed up? Okay."
"About the author: ""Tinsae Aregay has been following Tesla and The evolution of the EV space on a daily basis for several years. He covers everything about Tesla from the cars, to Elon Musk, the energy business and autonomy. Follow Tinsae on Twitter at for daily Tesla news"" I dont believe this is an objective piece..."
"The structural battery pack is quite impressive and does allow for lower manufacturing and assembly costs, while also reducing weight. The tradeoff is the complete and utter lack of repairability of the battery pack. The entire thing is sealed shut with structural foam, and includes not just the cells but the BMS system, battery coolant sytem, and the main contactors and relays. Eventually, if one of those parts fails, the entire battery pack will have to be scrapped and replaced. It also makes it much harder to repurpose batteries after the pack reaches end-of-life or the car is totaled in a crash, since individual cells or battery modules are nearly impossible to extract from the pack."
"Engineering and manufacturing are two different things folks. Something can be well engineered, but manufactured poorly. Toyota, the gold standard of manufacturing, is allowed to be impressed by Tesla’s engineering and the rest of the world can shit on Tesla’s build quality and both be right."
"People need to stop thinking Toyota is the god of quality. I’ve owned Tacomas for nearly 12 years. But the last 4 years I’ve had a Tesla, it’s honestly been a better vehicle. less problems, less maintenance, etc.. sure there are some paint issues and questionable body gaps, but my Tacomas weren’t perfect either."
"Wow thats high praise. Credit where its due, well done Tesla 👍🏻"
Good thing is that perception of Art is subjective...
"I’ve had everything from supercharged E92 M3s, E46 M3, Toyota FJ62/FJ80, Hellcat and I bought a Tesla 3 performance in 2021. Never looked back, I commute 6 days a week plug the damn thing in and forget about maintenance and gas. The car is as fast as a McLaren and I don’t feel guilty stepping on it. It’s one of the safest cars on the road and makes my commute a breeze. Still miss the E92 M3 though."
"Not that I disagree a TMC exec had some praise for Teslas underlying architecture, but Torque News and Electrek (also carrying this article) are basically Tesla shills so Id take their articles with a grain of salt. I dont see Teslas questionable ethics, abysmal safety record, and laughable quality control as ""works of art"" but hey, they do have a cutting edge electrical architecture and I agree there."
"I mean, he’s not wrong. The cars are extremely safe in crashes, highly aerodynamic and extremely cost-effective. They’re well-engineered vehicles. They just aren’t built right, but you don’t really notice those kinds of things when you’re disassembling a vehicle"
"There is a lot of advance engineering that goes into Teslas. It’s the implementation that is all messed up. I give it a few more years and I’d expect them to figure out the build quality/repair situation. With how often they’re redesigning internal parts I understand why they won’t sell parts to the owner. It’d severely limit their ability to improve existing parts. BTW, didn’t tesla say they had a few new colors that were available? Like the one pictured. I have yet to see that color anywhere besides generated photos. It looks great."
Weird. r/cars told me Tesla was trash
"Impressive as they may be, all their cars are overdue for redesign and competition is heating up."
Perhaps mechanically but it looks like a fucking turd
The 2023 Prius even looks better and nicer than a Tesla.
Actually this highlights how late they are. Structural battery goes for any dedicated EV chassis which Toyota currently dont have. Im sorry buy this was news when the Model S came out ten years ago.
"Lol, Tesla is recognized as one of the worse build cars in the world. How much Tesla shares the Toyota dude has i wonder. If you want to see work of art go in a porsche or audi e tron or Mercedes, or bmw. Tesla work of art, looool, like saying that hotdog is a 5 star menu."
Oh no we hate Toyota now
"Meanwhile everyone has overlooked this from the article: “structural battery pack”. Yep, the battery pack is part of the structure. Gee, let’s just make fuel tanks into bumpers."
I hope Toyota learned a lesson in what cars should look like.
"Rust under the back seats, body panels that dont line up, some of the worst paint on an automobile Ive ever seen and Toyota is impressed? Doesnt take much does it?"
Work of art? Thats the ugliest car sold on the market today
But Toyotas are ugly. Unless he talking 90s.
"A giant Japanese company like Toyota would never disparage another company publicly. Japanese people would most likely compliment anything they are shown and just quietly give their honest opinion among their close friends in private. Thats the culture. And from a business perspective, they gain nothing from saying negative things about Tesla and have everything to gain from praising them."
What an ugly car
The exec sure. Meanwhile the techs are all look at this bullshit.
"Until it self crashes or explodes, that is. :)"
"How is this a surprise. Tesla is leaps and bounds ahead of competitors and when it comes to the power engineering of the vehicle. Yes they suck at interiors and putting together the actual exterior shell, but that will get better with time. The germans manufac already have them beat when it comes to interiors and literally everything else. The germans manufacts also like to use higher voltages to reduce current needed and charge faster. The new Audi charges faster than the Telsa but the Tesla has more overall range. This is all from memory. I cant cite/fact check everything, please do that on your own accord. But really.. In all honesty, electric cars powered by batteries is not the solution. I do not want to reveal too much personal information about myself. But I know a lot of professors who are top in their fields, ranging from chemistry, to power electronics that know battery powered EVs are not scalable. But the industry, politicians/consumers already blindly on board and ignoring the critical issues. Yes EV+battery= product to market quickly, but EV+Battery= not scalable in the next decade"
"Tucked tee shirts, especially at the gym."
Fake news
It’s a fucking shapeless egg……mainstream car design is comparable to the colour beige. Uninspired and boring……
They werent even trying to tear it down. It just kind of fell apart before it got there.
This is gross. If Toyota buys tesla they will be sorely disappointed. How can they partner with bmw and gain access to some of the best manufacturing and engineering and then say this about tesla.
"Please Toyota, dont follow thier path..."
Its too bad that it looks like there is a giant iPad glued to the dashboard. The big screens in the middle of the dash are an eyesore.
why arent posts from random websites with no sources banned?
Hmm yes
"So in other news, young car journalists discovered sarcasm."
"If you look at Toyotas EVs (like the BZ4X/Solterra) you’ll see it’s very clearly built on an ICE car platform. The entire engine bay is occupied like an ICE car. You’d think Toyota would be able to build ANYTHING they want, they’re one of the biggest (if not the biggest) automakers on the planet. It just sounds like Toyota is behind the curve on pure EVs. Obviously they are leading when it comes to Hybrids"

Well we know this guy doesnt go to smu lol
What did they take?
[Suspect has been identified](
Thank you all for your help! The individual has been found by the police!
The people from the Salvation Army wear smu clothing and clothing from other universities. I assume it was donated in a large batch when they changed symbols the other year. He is 100% a guy from the Salvation Army on Gottigen
Live in the neighbourhood and have definitely seen this hoodie/vest/boots combo creeping around before. Usually spot him around the Maitland/Cornwallis group home or by the Salvation Army. Good luck with your search
In a time where its perfectly normal to wear a full black face mask and not look shady it blows my mind that this dude picked the shadiest look to do this.
does breaking the window set an alarm off? I thought he looked 40s or 50s until I realised he was wearing a scarf around his face
[deleted]
"Good luck, I hope he gets caught. I agree with the previous commenter that he is probably not young and has some type of physical issue. It he is local to the neighborhood try showing the video to some of the employees at the area liquor store."
Its interesting how many people break into cars surrounded by cameras and always recording when something moves near them lol Maybe it happens less to them? But theres video of it every time.
How did that flashlight break the window so easily?
I often see broken glass along that street between Cunard and Cornwallis (especially near where this car was parked). Wouldn’t be surprised if it’s the same guy.
" The suspect. The incident happened at 1:10 AM, March 18 on Creighton St in Halifax."
He’s definitely done this before
My dude only comes on Reddit when someone fucks with his Tesla Model Y.
Buddy cant even be bothered to tie his boots
Sorry I do not know the thief. The SMU logo might help but he doesnt look like a typical SMU student.
Addiction is a hell of a curmudgeon
My car was broken into on Creighton close to 2 weeks ago
"Damn those window smasher tools really do make quick work of windows. I have one in my car but never had to use it, cause Im not a douche and also havent been in an emergency."
I do hope they find the guy.. On a semi related note what is the model of the camera that caught this.. Quality is pretty high
Could have just said vehicle break in. This reminds me of iPhone users saying they have an iPhone not a cell phone unlike everyone else.
Gotta pay tuition and rent some how
I do hope they find the guy.. On a semi related note what is the model of the camera that caught this.. Quality is pretty high
"Cue the people talking about how hard times are forcing this. Sorry, this is a straight up POS with no regard for other people."
This guy and his buddies patrol very night looking in cars for opportunities. My car was robbed twice in the last few years. By permitting more and more tents this is the the type of person Council wants in your neighborhood. Seeing this a hole go down gives great joy
"Lol. I love how they had to tell us its a Tesla. I couldnt have just said ""car broken into."" Its true, though. A Tesla owner will let you know in any way possible they own a Tesla. Sorry for the break-in, and I hope you find him."
Q: what did the SMU grad say to the Dal grad? A: would you like fries with that?
"Most would just say their ""car was broken into"". What a flex."
Is that Bubbles from TPB?
Guy reminds me of a low confidence simp looking to build up courage to act on his thoughts. Hope you catch the perp.
Thats what you get for buying a Tesla
With long hospital wait times can you blame him?
Mask or face burns ?
Go Huskies!
He likely had a useless commerce degree :-) He almost needed the first aid kit for the shards of glass in his shoe lol. Maybe time for a citizen sting operation to teach these losers a lesson. Ill gladly use my vehicle as the bait vehicle. We can leave some Blockbuster VHS tapes on the seat and a Blackberry phone!
This isn’t going to help find them but worth noting that I saw this person wearing the exact same clothes walking by the Tim Hortons on lower water street on the evening March 8th. He caught my eye because my alarm bells were going off the way his face was almost completely covered like that.

"From the article: A tree fell and crushed a Tesla Model 3 during a recent storm in California. While the car is severely damaged, both passengers who were in the electric car are expected to be okay. This isnt the first time weve seen a report of a tree falling on a Tesla, and the previous stories also celebrated the EV for saving the people inside. While Tesla has been under much scrutiny for years for the quality and fit and finish of its vehicles, theres no doubt theyre built to take abuse and keep people safe. The Tesla Model 3 is designated as a Top Safety Pick+ by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), which is the organizations highest honor. It means not only did the EV get the top score in all crash tests, but also the top ratings for its crash avoidance and mitigation systems, which come standard. Tesla is also often under investigation for its advanced driver-assist systems, Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot, and Full Self-Driving Beta Capability. People are concerned that Tesla tests the systems on public roads with little restriction, though the technologies have been shown to limit accidents and injuries, much like similar technologies found in rival vehicles. At any rate, according to the San Mateo County Sheriffs Office, a Tesla Model 3 Performance was traveling on Old Honda Road near Skyline Boulevard in Portola Valley, California, when a tree fell in front of it and crushed the front end and windshield."
My buddy took a falling branch hit at 50mph with his wife and infant in the car. It took it like a champ and noone was injured despite roof glass shattering. I was impressed.
Why would full self drive do this?
Yeah but can it survive a 250-foot fall off a cliff? I don’t think so!
"I was expecting much worse base on the title…the tree basically fell on the frunk and nowhere else, not really surprised that nobody was injured lol."
[Linked tweet with image from the article]( [And direct link to image ](
What?! Fake news! The only thing a Tesla does is catch fire and autopilot into a school bus!
Modern vehicles are all extremely resilient against roof collapse. That’s exactly why its being removed from Testing by the IIHS
"Im so sick of these 1 of anecdotal evidence stories. Its safe because look at X, its unsafe because of Y. Thats not how actual safety is evaluated."
Honda road huh? #hondabump
Like that dad that drove his family off the cliff lmfao.
"Was rear ended while stopped behind a school bus in my model 3, but a car going 60mph. Flung my car 180 degrees, but minor damage to the vehicle and my family had no injuries. Got another one with insurance, was very impressed with how it held up from that collision. Posted the video on YouTube somewhere"
Always blows my mind that some of the safest cars on the road also have the worst quality control
"Ordered cybertruck in 2021 fully loaded, how do I go about purchasing it? I’ve heard they’ve been seen driving around. Respectfully, StrongLLC PS please msg me about this if you have experience. I hear the customer service is a large version of the bosses #2 on The Machinist. :)"
"When people choose the Ford Mach-E over Tesla, they are sacrificing safety to get a worse EV. You can say that about every other ICE car as well."
Unless it brakes in the middle of the freeway for no reason…they don’t really talk about that.
"In Vegas, right now. Had a Model 3 as an I Uber last night. We were sitting in the back seat & I pointed out to my wife the huge roll bar, right in front of us. Tesla has installed a NASCAR worthy roll cage, in plain sight, & most won’t even see it. Ingenious."
It’ll buff off
Couldve avoided the tree if they had a Cobb short shifter. /S
 Let’s not forget the guy who intentionally drove his car off the Pacific Northwest highway. No one on earth thought you could survive that
"Its comical that **anything** involving a Tesla in the local news, theyll specifically call out that it was a Tesla. ""A tree fell on a Tesla"" yet when they show any other brand, no mention of the brand. This happened a day or two ago, saw it on the news. On tonights local news, other vehicles showed crushed but again, didnt mention the brand once."

I usually dont like single month performance numbers since Tesla usually has a crazy delivery wave causing the first two months of the quarter to be tiny and then the third month to be huge. But this is the first month of the quarter. That is usually when Tesla sells the least. That should indicate an absolutely massive quarter. Will have to wait and see.
"Yeah i mean it costs as much as the cheapest possible Mercedes A class lol, the price is truly incredible for such a car"
"From the article: The Tesla Model Y is continuing to prove popular in Europe. The electric SUV topped sales charts in the region for the final two months of 2022, and the Model Y has picked up where it left off maintaining its place at the top of the electric vehicle (EV) sales charts in January 2023. According to data from JATO Dynamics The Model Y recorded 7,174 registrations in January. That was more than 69% higher than the second best selling EV in Europe, the Dacia Spring with had 4,242 registrations in the same time period. While claiming the top spot and being that far ahead of the second place competitor is certainly an impressive accomplishment by itself, it is even more impressive when you compare the starting price of the top two EVs. Prices obviously vary by country across Europe, but taking Germany as an example, the two most popular variants of the Model Y start at €44,890 for the Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) version and €54,990 for the Long Range. That is more than double the price of the Dacia Spring, which starts at €20,490. Rounding out the top five best selling EVs in Europe in January were the VW ID.4 (3,832), VW ID.3 (3,348), and the Fiat 500 (3,248). (via InsideEVs)"
Tesla is building and shipping 5800 cars per day. around the world. it will take a long time for everybody to catch up. because this is theyre starting point and theyre going straight up. Mexico is going to open. gigafactory Nevada is going to pick up. semi trucks are coming. cybertruck coming. and dont forget about the power packs power walls around the world. Teslas a class act. you might not like Elon musk but guess what the mother fucker knows what hes doing.
"Well, just wait until the established automakers starts making EVs!"
"Not taking ANYTHING away from Tesla because they have executed on all fronts extremely well and still have a commanding lead but ""Top Selling"" could easily be replaced with ""Most Readily Available"" EV in almost any local - at least here in the states. The 65 closest Ford dealers to me only have a total of 61 Mach Es in various states of inventory or in transit. The local KIA dealer has 1 EV6 GT marked with a $6,500 market adjustment. The 2 others have none. Try finding a Lightning at your local dealer. If Hyundai were to wave a magic wand and could build enough Ionic 6s to have 15-20 at every dealer I guarantee it would be a different story. As long as everyone else continues to play catch-up and fails to deliver even a fraction of demand, these numbers will continue to be in Teslas favor."
It’ll be the top selling car before this year is over.
"Here in Germany, they are everywhere now. When we took delivery, the Model Y was still kind of a rare sight and people - especially kids - waved at us all the time. Now there are 3 or 4 just in my tiny, super conservative neighborhood. Its insane."
I had no idea SUVs sold sell in Europe at all.
"A lease involves you paying for the difference between ""what the car is worth new"" and ""what we figure the car will be worth in three years."" In the case of this lease, they want $4,500 down and then $384 a month. That means youre paying $18,324 to get a car that costs $44,000 new, and then drive it for three years. Do you think a 3 year old one of these cars will be worth more than $25,676 when youre done with it? (Hint: theyre selling 3 year old ones right now for $36,100.) Also, this car has a $7,500 federal tax credit available. So, this is a car someone could buy for $44,000 and get $7,500 back in a tax refund next year - so, it will cost $36,500 for them to buy it. And then they can sell it in three years for $36,100; it will cost them $400 to have it for three years. Or, someone could lease it instead and pay $18,000 instead of $400 for the privilege. Youre damn right its too good to be true. If youre the leasing company."
Any sort of down-payment on a leased vehicle is a bad idea.
"Also don’t forget, never put money down on a lease!"
Too good to be true? You gotta put down $4500! Plus you gotta pay taxes and fees. To only keep it for 3 years. Idk
I have a Model 3 and my wife has the RAV4. Tesla lease deals are awful due to no buyout option at the end. I would buy so you can get the tax credit and state rebate if your state offers it. Does your electric panel and service support 220V charging at home? I would not get an EV without a level 2 home charger
"No. $4,500 down for a lease is always a bad deal. A lease needs to be $0 down (or a low amount down) to be worth it. Also a Tesla lease is not like a traditional lease, it’s more or a long term rental. At the end of a Tesla lease the vehicle must be returned, there is no option to buy the vehicle out for the residual value."
"Beware you can not sell Tesla leases. If you want to get out of the lease early, or have equity at the end, your options will be very very limited."
4500 down plus u can’t buy out 3 or Y leases is bad
Why you putting money down on a lease?
"Is that 12000 miles per year, or 12000 miles over 3 years?"
It sounds good because it seems like a low payment for an expensive car but it’s not as good as you may think.
"A leAse is a rental ,that’s why it sounds good"
Aren’t you unable to purchase the car after the lease?
Remember when Elons mouth was used to increase the value of their cars?
"I’ve never leased before, is that saying you can drive it for 12,000 miles (and then they start charging you for mileage over that) in 3 years? I drive that in less than a year."
Paying close to $20k to have nothing after 3 short years sounds awful
"Every $1000 down is about $30 to $35 per month. Depending on where you are, taxes probably add $25-$50 per month. Reg fees prob add $10/mo. Remove the downpayment, add in taxes and registration fees, and this is more like $600/mo. Is that a good deal? Probably not. If you can put down $7500 and roll taxes and fees into a 6 year loan at 5%, youd be at about $615/mo. Then youd get a $7500 check for tax credits to reimburse your downpayment. Toss that towards principal after a year and youd be done in like 50 months total. On the flip side, if you want to drive a Tesla and dont want to own a Tesla for more than 3 years and are concerned Elon might do something dumb to make them worthless (a non zero possibility) then its the way to go."
Any kind of lease is always usually a bad idea.
"All the people saying don’t put $1 down on a lease. Go ahead and find that deal anytime between now (real life) and 2018. Even then it wasn’t easy. I leased a vehicle in 2018. Income 100k+. Credit 820+. Still had to put 3-4k down on a 50k vehicle. Reddit becomes way too idealistic when it comes to real life shit. Please somebody, give me one real life example of putting 0 down on a vehicle nicer than a Toyota Camry."
You have to deal with being an owner of the shittiest cars on the planet. Its so cheap because nobody would actually pay a normal amount for a rolling trash can like a tesla.
Doesn’t look cheap to me. And those model 3s are cheaply built econoboxes.
... its a model 3 too. Nothing to special
"Everyone talking about the money.. What about the mileage? 36 months, 12,000 miles.. Thats 4,000 miles a year. I mean, if you want to pay them to park a car in your driveway for three years..."
Bad quality low price simple as that.
"Consider the miles and how youre going to use the car. 12,000 miles over three years would be very difficult for most people in the US to manage for something that isnt a second car. Thats only about 300 miles a month and mileage penalties are no joke. And when you consider the mileage limitation, youre paying more than $1.50 per mile. Buying the car would be easy more cost effective if you can afford it."
Do leases qualify for the 7500?
Get a Toyota bro! To charge ur little car is going to take 1 hour
So the biggest problem here is that they give you 12k miles for 3 YEARS. 😂 most people drive 12-16k miles a year. A lot of people do 20k miles a year. So basically you would have to pay for the difference in those miles which can be astronomical. It would be closer to $1000 a month if you Add in the extra miles. So yeah this is 🧢
You can see at the bottom of the photo 384 est month after 317 in “potential” gas savings. Your monthly payment is actually close to 700.
"If you owe more than 7500 in federal tax, buy it; otherwise lease it. At lease end you have the option to buy at pre-determined price."
"If you wanna throw money away, this is an amazing deal."
"Not bad! A better option, if you dont mind putting in a little work, is to find a 22 $100k+ MB EQS 450. Some folks are leasing it around $450 - $500 a month with very little down (less than $2k)"
I just saw one on fire on the highway. Sounds like a bad deal.
"Well you also arent buying it. So yeah it’s like renting a $40,000 object for three years."
You’re putting 4500 down on a lease. That’s 4500 you will never get back. That’s an extra $125 if you divide 4500 by 36 months.
"RAV4 is gonna be built much better, more reliable, similarly priced and there’s tons of incentives for electric cars. Buy the RAV4"
"Is 12,000 miles over 3 years fairly average for lease agreements? Seems very low."
The problem with a model 3 lease is that you have no option to buy the car after your term. You have to return it. That alone is worth passing on the deal.
"Are you electrically equipped to charge it? If yes, proceed. If no, figure out how much the hardware will cost you. I think Tesla does it’s own insurance thing because they monitor how you drive and collect your data, so it could be very affordable for you. They are comparatively heavy, so basic consumables will go faster in general, but not the end of the world. They don’t use real leather, but “vegan leather” which is synthetic and petroleum based. They do have a few issues with quality control, so check it over real good as some stupid things can go wrong. Apparently the Model Y is having difficulty with their steering wheels popping off, but I don’t know if this extends to the Model 3. Regardless, as long as you check it over like any other car, and are equipped to fuel/maintain it, you’ll greatly enjoy it."
"Leasing is always a bad deal and I would never suggest it to anyone. Plenty of videos on that so not going into that. If you can afford it, buy it, otherwise think about getting a different car that is in your budget. Don’t overextend yourself especially now. If you care about the environment nothing is better then not having a car, yes even electric. E-bikes and transit is the better option, however most places besides mayor cities don’t have the infrastructure. If you don’t care to much stick with a regular gas car as they are still much more affordable."
Toyota is a better buy because of federal Rebate if you get Rav4 Prime. its like 7500$ off.
Also looks like you can only drove this 12k miles in 36 months...thats only ~350 miles a month.
"What is the point in leasing an expensive electric car, or a reliable base model Toyota that will run forever? If you drive so little that a lease works for you, just buy a reliable gas car. The gas is not going to be more expensive than what you lose in a lease. And if leasing, why go for something expensive and high quality like a base model Toyota? Get something cheap and American, pay less and have more features, and then give it back before the repairs start. Or just buy something."
Imagine buying an EV when theyre brand new to reality and pricing.
You can’t buy out a Tesla lease tho
Keep in mind that Tesla currently doesnt let you buy off the car when the lease ends.
It’s wild to me that Apple Pay is even a possibility
Id much rather have a RAV4 than a Tesla 3. I think most people would.
Haha yeah - would love one but rarer than a lottery winning ticket to buy other than outrageously priced 2nd hand!! Gts awd with the whale tale wing for me - way more practical and way better in wet conditions than the gt3 :-)
Have you watched the car care nuts review of the Tesla model Y?
You will own nothing and be happy. Im so sick of this crap.
"Yes, I just put 16k down on a 51k car. Initial rates on a 60 mo were 7.5%…. I decided to do a 2.9% over 36mo instead…. My $1085/mo payment makes this look like a dream. 20/40/10 rule. But honestly I just got out of a lease and not having any “equity” in your vehicle sucks when you’re forced to get something else or buy it out at the end of the leasing period. I’d rather own now and drive it into the ground. Just my 2 cents."
“$4500 down” “36 months” “too good to be true” 😂 ok op
“$4500 down” “36 months” “too good to be true” 😂 ok op
“$4500 down” “36 months” “too good to be true” 😂 ok op
"This number is pretty or VERY accurate from my own experience. I leased my Model 3 about 2 weeks ago and the calculator was spot on. The only exception to this was Tax. Make sure to add sales take 10% (its 9.5 but still, in LA where I am) to the whatever lease total. My original calculator lease was 387$. Blue exterior + 19s + White interior. Add tax into the number and it sits around 430$. My actual lease price was 420-ish, which lines right up with the calculator considering the sales tax is 9.5 not 10. This number really is too good to be true for Tesla, not to us consumers. My 2022 Audi Q5 is currently leased at 650 + tax so around 720 and that cars sticker price is only somewhat above what the Model 3 would be worth in cash. Include things like maintenance plans and insurance for scuffs/damages (essentially a no questions asked return coverage) and Im looking at having 2 Model 3s for 1 Q5 in terms of lease. In general Teslas are not great to lease according to most people, especially since you cant buy the 3/Ys out (And Model S/X after certain date) and combine the fact that they hold so much value but I prefer driving a brand new car for my daily driver so my daily main car is always leased."

"Ive been driving a Tesla Model 3 2021 SR+ for the last 2 years! However this is my first time purchasing my own Tesla. Considered getting a Tesla Model S but found they simply arent anywhere near as good from a value for money perspective! In the end I found this Tesla Model 3 SR+ 2020 with only 35k miles on the odometer with plenty of warranty and brand new set of tires. The car was also wrapped in Satin Dark Grey by the original owner which is still in great condition. Additionally, the rear windows have been tinted, its had a full chrome delete and the headlights and rear lights have also been tinted. I think its an amazing time to get a used Tesla in the UK with all the negative market forces at play. How much do you think its worth/ how much do you think I paid for it?"
"Still don’t know about Tesla’s,I wouldn’t say they are the greatest looking cars on the road but technology wise they are great"

Sorry but no
Yea colour looks really smart 👌
Wow! Looks ace! 👍 Enjoy!!
Nice colour
Looks great! The tired jokes you’ll get are from people who haven’t driven one. I rented a Plaid in the US a few months back and it was by far the most impressive car i’ve ever driven.
So the negative market forces have been pushing EV prices down?
I like it

Your first Tesla Model 3 ? How many do you plan to Buy ?
"Driven one and it was very uncomfortable, Stiff suspension felt every small crack on the road. Not sure if it was stock base model but it felt cheap and plasticy inside. Driven better equipped Kias.

"Are you in the hyper-aggressive gotta use that incredible acceleration at all times gang, or the dawdling to save on battery gang? Have to admit that colour looks awesome!"
thats a colour i would stand behind.
"First Tesla that’s not white, red or blue 🎉🎉"
"That looks great, I love the colour. I’d personally be a bit put off by the notion of controlling everything via a touchscreen, but aside from that I actually really like the ‘car’ Teslas."
No registration plate. Looks infinitely better this way.
Love the colour
Did you buy through Tesla official website or auto trader?
"What are doing about a front number plate? I’ve seen a few get stick on ones, so keeping that aero efficiency."
"Did you buy it with the wrap, or get it done yourself?"
Theyre a fun car but theres no denying the build quality and consistency can be absolute shit.
"I really like that, great colour combo. The wheels really let it down though IMO. Put a nice set of bigger rims on and it would look stunning 😍"
Looks lovely.congrats
"Niiiice, congrats! Which spec did you go for? And did you buy it outright? The silver looks amazing, Ive actually not seen it before. And I think the aero wheels are the way to go in the UK as they keep the rainwater off the seldom-used brakes. Ive got mine as a company car, Im saving up to buy one outright once the lease is up. Plan is to run it into the ground."
Still going to be considering an M3/M5 instead of any electric car for while and for next car purchase.
Love it. Need to grab myself a tesla!
"Nice ride, Id love one of these."
"That looks gangsta, fuck the haters."
"Welcome to the most boring club in the world. Not because of the car, thats great, because of the inane questions and comments."
Well done 👏
Is the colour standard or a wrap. But well done mate 👍
Siiiiick! Congrats!
Great colour combo
Serious question how long do the batteries last and are they economical to repair replace recell whatever its called
"You’re going to get haters on here who are “petrol heads”, but really just envious/ignorant because they’ve never experienced the ridiculous acceleration. I’ve driven a dual motor one of these and it was absolutely great fun, I didn’t even try ludicrous mode!"
Congrats mate! Love it 🤍
Yuck
Huge congratulations 👏
I hope your happy and the range is sufficient. Ignore the haters.
Why?!
Congrats on the new-to-you car! It looks fantastic and I’m sure the performance is spectacular 😀
"I hate them, but I see you have actually ""bought"" it so fair play."
"Congrats mate. Were living in the future. Let the haters start frothing at the mouth, theyre really pathetic, theyll protest until their blue in the face that its not envy, unable to comprehend why you didnt just buy a the cheapest diesel VAG car in your budget. I see youve had a Model 3 before so youre used to the endless streams of foolish people completely unaware how quick electric cars are, theyll tailgate you in dense traffic (hard of thinking, bless them) but have no answers when the road opens up. Long may they continue to be educated, much as r/cartalkuk loves to universally hate on anything they dont have any former experience of!"
Haha you’re gonna make the neckbeards furious with this post 😂
Not a fan of most EVs but I’m in love with the Tesla series. Especially in midnight silver. This is stunning. Did you get the one with full self driving capability?
What colour interior?
"Solid commuter car, I like the colour too."
Kinda reminds me of Peugeot
Ditch the aero covers
Teslas are super ugly but this colour is pretty cool
"That is a really nice wrap on it there, though Id be changing the wheels at some point, notuch of a fan of the aero ones though I know they have a function"
"love me EVs, ate Teslas, simple as"
"A lot of people are talking about the build quality. From my recollection, early models had issues, but its the US ones that still have these build quality issues. Iirc, the US ones are manufactured in a different country to the UK ones, and they suffer for that."
Slinky looking thing. Nice mate!
why do they make them so cheap looking?
Condolences.
[deleted]
The colour on this one is pretty cool but I find these cars so boring looking and you see them everywhere
If this was 2016 thatd be great. Unfortunately every other car manufacturer builds a cheaper better electric car.
I shall not be dissing anyone here but I hate electric cars. Sorry for your loss OP…
I would have brought it if it was a petrol v6
I cant imagine ever giving that twat Musk a penny of my money.
My condolences
Wouldnt touch it with a 20 foot barge pole. Good luck selling it on in a few years. The tyres will be worth more than the car!
"Whoops. Lets hope absolutely nothing breaks on it, or youre a millionaire."
Unlucky
Your house looks like Saxondale’s
That manhole is pedestrian rated.
"Has every 30 something in the UK got rich parents or something? Congratz, Im sick of hearing how well my age group are doing in comparison and Im jealous."
Will it fold up to fit in that Garage?
"I absolutely love the colour on this! Very sleek and suits the car! Was this paint/wrap? I know there are a few Model S’s in silver and they always look stunning! Anyway, I hope you enjoy it very much. If you didn’t know already, I think you can get sticker number plates for the car. It looks far sleeker."
🤮 not for me personally . But enjoy your purchase .
Yeah nobody wants to see this.
"Kudos, although I like Tesla, 2 reasons I won’t get one. 1. Out of my price range 2. I prefer short stops to fuel up and not having to wait around for an hour or so at a time."
Well done you bought a car single handedly responsible for popularising EVs at a time where the world is not yet ready for EVs fully and now companies refuse to research other ways such as hydrogen. Sheep.
Your garage looks tiny compared to the car. Is it really that small?
First of many?
Good luck with that!
Nope for me
Congratulations you own a shitbox.
Joey
"The fact Musk is a massive bell end is what puts me off Teslas. That and I live in the country, not sure how good they would be on the bumpy roads I take to get home"
No one gives a shit
my condolences. Had they run out of I4s?
Lol this is like bragging about buying an iPhone
How embarrassing.
Did you lose a bet?
Looks really nice man! Defo a colour way I would get onboard with. Enjoy the new motor mate.
Such a nice car but your home is still the typical UK brick colour.. damn
"Its a no from me because of Elon being the greatest disappointment to humanity of all time, but the colour does make it look much better than usual."
Like the colour. Makes it look pretty mean
mind if i ask why? i have an EV and it cost half the price of a Tesla with similar range and better build quality.. i just don’t understand the Tesla hype? and yes ive test driven them. the only thing mine lacks compared to a Tesla is the “speed” but ive got a sporty petrol car that does that anyway. i goto say tho.. the colour of this Model 3 is epic!
That’s the nicest looking model 3 I’ve seen. The colour really rocks. Still a heap of shit tho. Do you have to pay a monthly subscription for the heated seats!?
Your first? How many are you planning on buying? Also doesnt it need a front number plate?
"Dont drive it over that man hole!! Thats a pedestrian grade man hole cover, not for vehicles. If youre in a new build property, have the developers change it for a suitable load bearing lid."
Is it just perspective or is that a go kart size garage?
"163,000km in 2 years! What actual f*ck! Did they drive it to the moon and back?"
Thats alot of Kms
Battery life/ health ?.
"Absolutely not, that car is worth around 30k with 163,00kms There are 2020 with 50,000 kms for 6k more"
I didnt expect to have to do so much downvoting. Good luck with your decision anyhow. Price is good but definitely ex taxi so wear and tear may be higher. How this affects you has been well addressed by others I think so maybe self insure for a new battery just to be safe. You can even keep the funding in a index or tbills
"This is great, another thread for people who have never owned a Tesla or driven one to talk about how theyd never get one as the build quality is so bad, because they heard that from their neighbours boyfriends dog. Back to the post, I sold my 2020 long range model 3 a while back with 100,000kms on it (I do 40-45 a year) and the range was only a few percent off what it was brand new. Typically the range drops a few percent in the first 10,000kms then stays like that for donkeys. Much to the disbelief of the anti tesla brigade, the build quality was totally fine and even with 100,000km on it it had no breaks, rattles, drove dead straight and still absolutely took off like a scalded cat. I must admit Id be cautious of getting any car with 160,000km but thats because Im more at the stage in my life where Id prefer a new car. Im quite sure that car will be fine for many more hundred thousand ks."
"In my view it’s a horrible deal. That’s hella kms. And Teslas are impossible to sell at the moment. Have a look on Carsales at Teslas with fewer than 500km. There are HEAPS of them, over 100 across Australia. And they’re not selling. I’d wager you could get one of them for under $60k, just offer the ten cheapest vendors $59k and tell them all that you’re making the same offer to nine other sellers and you’re buying the first car whose vendor accepts."
I think the most important things is the battery life. According to google most of them last about 1500 cycles. But this car has done 160k km in 2 years which would mean they are deep cycling (completely draining) the batteries which significantly reduce overall battery life. Since you can’t replace the batteries on a Tesla and you will have to completely replace the car when the batteries stuffed. I’d say it’s probably not worth your while
"My 16 year old Ford Fiesta doesn’t even have that many kms, where tf have they been going"
Wouldnt buy one of these heaps of shit for any price
Way too many km. let some other rando get it
"It should be able to do another 500k km. Don’t listen to idiots not owning Tesla or any EV. I would check degradation of the battery, Google how"
Limo kms.
"Insane KMs, thats why"
You can get one with far less miles for a few more thousand. Easy answer.
Thats alot of Ks for 2 years. I would be wary of wear and tear on the car.
Why wouldnt you spend the extra $3000 and get [this one]( with a third of the KMS from NSW
 Just spoke with tesla service because I am seriously considering a Tesla as a new car and they are telling me that battery replacements cost 16-30k. The rep also told me that you cannot use ANY battery chemistry with ANY drivetrain. They must be compatible.
All this thread taught me is that we cant call shit cars shit anymore cause an eccentric wholesome 100 redditor billionaire made them
Thats an Ubered car. My cousin uses her Tesla Y as Uber too lol
Run
"Yep, I’d offer a little under the asking price. But if the rest of the vehicle is in really good condition (get an independent check!) then go for it."
That’s a lot for two years
ex-Uber Premium car I suspect.
Has Ashish come to the table mate? We’re all rooting for a good deal here mate 👊
"That is a really good deal, cheaper Tesla’s are hard to come by. Also, if you are concerned at durability, look into the high KM examples out of the US, there isn’t a great deal of high KM ones here yet. Edit, here is a good article on one that they put 1500k on and when it had work done on it.  Also, here is an article for a 500k model 3. "
"Thats a great deal, even with the mega kms. The car is good for at least 500,000km. Its still under drivetrian warranty for another 7 years too. If youre serious about buying it, take this down, because someone will snap it up."
lol look at all the salty Karens in this thread
I wouldnt buy a Tesla for any amount of money personally The build quality on them is utterly atrocious and theyre ludicrously expensive to service/repair if any parts need replacing Literally any other electric car for the sake price tag will be better
Just swap the battery and you are good to go champ!
Be careful buying electric cars second hand. Check the batteries. Avoid if possible.
No Tesla is good deal. Except a good deal of trouble !
You got 30k handy for a battery replacement? Just buy a diesel bro…
Be prepared to spend some money on it
Yuck Id rather walk
Not a good deal. Its a Tesla
"Please do not buy a used Tesla, I work in transport and Ive never heard anything good about them. Thats also 60,000km a year which is insane."
It just struck me! Why dont we make a cart or a wagon out of recycled plastics and use a horse to pull it?
What fuckwit wants a Tesla? Grow a brain. 😂
Shithole America car innit lads 🇬🇧 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 buy Japanese lad. Dont lose your limbs on maintenance cost of Tesla.
Teslas are garbage
Dont. 100 dont.
"Look… You *could* buy a second hand car that could explode at any moment. Or, and hear me out here, you could buy any other EV."
"Plenty of room on the back window for all your stickers ie: I support Ukraine, Ive had ten Covid jabs, I support Pride month, I support BLM. etc,etc,etc..."
Too many ks youll be up for a new battery replacement soon that will cost about 30k US price
"Based on what my AU had on it when I sold it, Id expect at least 600,000 km out of a car"
"Go have a look at it and check the interior wear and tear, would expect ex-taxi or ride share with those km so this is where the high usage will show up. Still 6+ years of battery warranty left. Check what tyres he has on it and when they were last replaced, budget $2k for replacement if needed. Put aside a few hundred for a decent detail. Make a serious offer of $40k due to km and condition (if average) and see how you go."
"Prices are falling on these for several reasons. Id spend a bit more for one with much less kays or something else. once a car reaches 200,000km will of lost most of its value. I think most people including myself wouldnt touch a 200,000km Tesla."
Get Camry 2018
"With regards to the discussion about battery life herein: It’s not how many km’s the car has travelled per se, but more importantly, how the battery was utilised. Constantly deep cycling the battery and recharging after prolonged periods at the discharge stage will cause the battery life to diminish much quicker. Cruising range of this model is ~490km but city driving brings this down to ~350km. Assuming a mix of this then average range is ~ 420km. It currently has 163,000km on the clock so it would of had ~390 full recharge by now if it were deep cycled. That is a lot for two years, because battery is deemed to provide 1500 cycles and about 20-30years of drivability. The car has not only lost more drivability life but is out of warranty because it’s gone past 160k or 4 years (the warranty bit not 100% certain so correct me if I’m wrong). Either way it’s a gamble I would not risk."
"current price is 65K plus on roads, then rebates. If you can get in on the no fbt deal with a novated lease then that would work out possibly cheaper than this case which doesnt qualify"
That is a fantastic deal. I’ve had two model 3s and they aren’t build like regular cars. There are teslas with 800k kms on them in great condition.
Buy new if you have the dosh as model 3 are in stock really for delivery now on many states
"The actual motors and mechanics are probably still fine cause electric cars are so mechanically simple that they really dont wear out the same way a combustion car does. The battery however will be loosing its juice and need a replacement, unfortunately tesla doesnt recycle or replace the batteries, so although its a perfectly fine car you cant buy one with that many Ks cause its dead, a real shame Elon decided to go down that route as lithium batteries can be recycled to create more batteries (and theyd have the same performance as a freshly mined lithium battery as its not the lithium that dies when you use a lithium battery) which is an especially lucrative business when lithium deposits are running so incredibly low right now. Honestly as far as EVa go, the Polestar is the best, it uses both an induction motor and a PMSYNRM motor to create an (almost) variable area of flux motor which means the top model with an induction motor up front and a PMSYNRM motor in the rear can make its advertised range (within a small margin of error of course, much like a petrol car) in almost any environment regardless of speed, luggage, and how hilly the roads are or how bad the traffic is, unlike the Teslas which can only make their advertised range doing 20kph downhill because Elon is too dumb to understand the benefits and drawbacks of PMSYNRM motors in comparison to induction motors and BLDC motors and as such the teslas he produces always fall short of their claims."
10k per year was pretty standard so I wouldnt go anywhere near this fucking car.
That’s gotta be an ex Uber to rack up that many km in Such a short time.
Dont miss this chicks content hehe spicy asf 
"163,000 mileage is around 81,500/year Or 6,790kms/month Or 226kms/day Thats a crazy number."

What a surprise…. Brake lights didn’t come on as anyone could see in the video
Mustve thought the accelerator was the brake given its one pedal drive /s
Of course there will be no follow up by all the tesla shorts on Twitter
wrong levaaaaaaaaa
Im shocked. Really. Just shocked. Absolutely. Shocked.
*shocked Pikachu face*
#idiotsincars Even if the driver thought hes pressing the brake he could as well use the emergency brake by long pressing the button on the gear stalk.
Tesla bears will still find a way to make it look like it was Teslas fault
Oh. Gee. Shocked. Anyway…
"The bit that I find sad here is that all this person had to do was take their foot away from any pedals. If the car seems like its accelerating for no reason, take your foot off and let friction do the rest. They clearly panicked and the collateral is very sad."
"To this day, FUD rules. I never realized how fucked up we’re as a society, it’s amazing we’ve had as much progress as we have. I mean, sure, safety is great, BUT NOTHING IS 100%."
O you don’t say
I know a guy who can buff that out
Go figure
"Ooooo, that car is smarter than the media"
What a shocker...
Does it make sense that the car was coming to a stop then accelerated. Unless it was intentional.
To the surprise of no one. You mean the car didnt just go rogue and decide today was the day ?! We didnt witness the birth of a new form of life?!!!/!?!!1!11!
I just watched the crash video linked in the article. holy. shit.
"So all those seething redditors claiming this was Autopilot, where are they now?"
"Ive had this happen before a couple times in my many years of driving, thankfully i also always press the clutch pedal at the same time - all i got was loud revving and a dawning realization that i almost fucked up. Electric cars have no clutch pedal so if this would happen on an electric can i wouldve definitely crash through someones kitchen. I think electric cars need to have a clutch pedal, but for a different purpose: * Completely disable all acceleration when touching the pedal regardless of what the accelerator is doing. * Pressing the pedal would increase regen break, and drivers would naturally learn to use this pedal to minimise use of disc brakes. * The above functionality can be reversed with a toggle, allowing this ""clutch pedal"" to gradually decrease regen brake power, allowing the car to coast thus mimicking combustion engine behaviour. * Option: if the accelerator was engaged when this pedal is touched, the accelerator must be completely disengaged in order for it to start working again. This is to avoid degenerate behaviour of throttling both pedals back and forth to modulate motor power. Might be an interesting setting to disable in Track Mode. Overall, this is obviously a skill issue, learn to drive, get better training, yada-yada-yada. But at the end of the day were all human and no matter how skilled you are all it takes is ONE oopsie to screw up your entire life. Combustion engines have clutch pedals that, i hope, were all trained to press alongside the brake pedal when we want to decelerate, so even if we somehow screw up the brake we still got the clutch disengaged and not sending the car into a wall or, God forbid, another person. We can repurpose this pedal that everyone already knows how to use into something useful and an additional failsafe. And before you argue ""self driving cars hurr durr"" - theyre not coming any time soon, until i can legally fall asleep in my car and it can take me into my garage on its own across the country with no driver i dont care about any of those arguments - when we get there we can remove it, its easy to remove things."
One pedal drive makes you think accelerator is brake. This happened to me MANY times in my Model 3. I now set regen to low and always make an effort to apply SOME pressure on the brakes so I keep that muscle memory.
This is a bad headline. The article states the police investigation isn’t over so yah tsla investigated itself… that’s like police departments investigating themselves too. 100% accelerator? Not 99 or 98. That’s a manufacturer error. Not even a race car driver would have a constant 100% pressed accelerator.
[deleted]
I wonder if the floor mat got twisted and helped cause the accelerator issue?
Malcolm Gladwell has a lot to say about this: [Toyota Acceleration Pedal](
This happens a lot with ICE vehicles. In the early 90s there was a huge investigation after someone plowed into a mall. The finding was that it was all driver error. They even tested and prove that it was not possible to drive a car with both pedals depressed. That braking power always overrode accelartor. One recommendation for some vehicles was the brake pedal to align more with the steering column as driver when mashing the brake expects it to be right below the steering wheel center.
Anyone else looking at the stroller?
The fact that Mercedes says they will be liable when level three automated driving is engaged and Tesla will not take liability when their “full self driving” is engaged tells you everything you need to know.
I don’t know how the fuck Tesla continues to be able to sell a ‘full self driving’ product that’s known to have a massive safety issue.
Looks like a change in the light to dark caused it?
I havent been following much but does the FSD feature in its current state still require the driver to have their hands on the wheel and be at the ready to take full control of the vehicle?
Phantom braking sucks.
What gets me is how it stops with plenty of room behind it but no one seem to believe that it has stopped and continues to drive into it.
"What was the Tesla driver doing? His car didnt just slam on the breaks it just came to a stop. The guy behind him had no problem stopping, it was the 5 cars behind them that couldnt. They had 5-10 seconds to intervene and speed back up If you continuously ignore the warnings to put a hand on the wheel the car will eventually stop itself. Is that what happened?"
The car slows down and stops for some reason. The driver just get out of the car... Did he try to resume driving and did the car died there? Strange situation. Autopilot was engaged but how everybody is excluding another car malfunction? Isnt it too early to jump on conclusion?
A hitman is cheaper
"Except it didnt have full self driving engaged, because that doesnt exist. Dont repeat Teslas bullshit for them."
"Ive said it before and Ill say it again. Public streets should not be used to test technology. Especially when the company testing the technology wont even assume legal culpability for injury or deaths that resulted from their products. Add to that the outright lies and false advertising of their Full Self Driving vehicles and I question why theyre still being allowed to produce cars with incomplete FSD systems. EVs are the future of automobiles, self driving remains to be seen."
>The surveillance camera footage from the crash scene shows that there was nothing in front of the Tesla to justify braking So it wasnt actually driver error this time? Just computers being computers and randomly acting weird for no reason
"There’s no source for the headline’s claim that NHTSA confirmed this - just the same old report that the driver claimed FSD Beta was engaged. And, of course, FSD Beta clearly and repeatedly warns drivers to stay alert and in control, which rather obviously this driver did not do."
Full Self-Destruction
"Wow, person takes hands off wheel and causes pileup. Who would have guessed that one. Self driving isn’t 100% full proof yet. It shouldn’t even be a thing yet."
"I get all the blame going teslas direction but why is no one talking about the driver, it’s their car, they are responsible for it. As I understand they can immediately take over from FSD, why didn’t they? You get behind the wheel, it’s your job, doesn’t matter if it has FSD or simple lane assist, still your job."
"The child injured wasnt even in the first 3 or 4 cars to crash and they suffered a bruise. The driver of the Tesla was elderly and activated FSD shortly before the crash and was clearly either not paying attention or lacked the reflexes to take over in all the time the car was apparently doing something they didnt want. They should have lightly touched the wheel, brake, or accelerator and FSD would have turned off immediately and prevented this. Additionally many of the drivers involved were either traveling too quickly for conditions or not paying attention. I get it everyone wants to blame the Tesla but this took a lot of humans driving poorly to cause."
"The selection of Tesla only related crashes is astounding. Where are the stats on how many people died in car accidents, driven by humans, that day alone across the country? Everyone loves to cherry pick one accident involving a Tesla but conveniently ignore the on average 85 deaths per day in the United States alone."
"Its not working, disable the feature. FFS why did they remove the proximity sensors? Cost maybe? Worst rated US car company in quality standards."
"following too close is the leading cause of accidents, if people were paying attention and leaving space this would have been a story of a Telsa being rear ended because it cut someone off."
"Full Self Driving is such a fraudulent term. Tesla does not have that and never has. At best its assisted driving. AI driving devs have stated the technology wont be viable in our lifetimes, but that hasnt stopped marketing ghouls and assholes like Musk from falsely labeling their cruise control as FSD anyways. That kind of nonsense is criminally irresponsible and should be treated as such."
"Even if it was engaged, you can always just take control. Steer yourself. Press the accelerator. To my knowledge, there has never been a case of the car fighting against the driver. There is still more to this story."
"You rear-end somebody, its almost always your fault."
"If it cant pass a driving test like a human, it shouldnt be on the road."
Did anyone else immediately think of Handlebars by Flobots when watching that vid? The tune isnt the same but its damn close
"""Full Self Driving"" ... what a scam. The technology is at least 20 years away from being actual full self driving. Cant believe regulators still allow the limited functionality to be called FSD, its completely misleading."
"If Tesla was a European auto maker this would lead to ten years of smear campaigns and billions of dollars in fines. Toyota, stuck gas pedal that turned out was aftermarket carpets used by people.. VW faking emission the same way Tesla fakes self driving tech."
I cant take my eyes of a CNC machine for fear it may mess up I cant believe anyone wouldnt watch self driving like it was your kid behind the wheel for the first time.
The government needs to step in and stop Tesla from beta testing with our lives at risk.
DON’T TRUST ELON - HE IS NOT A FUCKING GENIUS!
How many non-Teslas caused crashes this week?
Kinder surprise was banned for les than that in the USA...
"If you remove your radar and laser sensors and rely solely on cameras for self-driving control, youre gonna have a bad time."
"I understand the outrage, but yall acting like a human driver never causes pileups due to user error."
"Can we get an AI to write this article instead of the hack who actually wrote it? It might be quite the improvement! >Tesla has stripped its cars from every sensor except video cameras, which might be the main cause."
How many accidents caused by humans occurred on that day?
Gee maybe cars can’t drive themselves.
"My question is, wtf was the driver doing."
Hey Elon Musk tweet about how the left radicals are weaponizing this….
"May cause an accident, but all the clowns driving too close at fault too..."
"Heres something nobody in the thread wants to talk about I guess. Youre 6x less likely to get into an automobile accident in a Tesla (roughly 1 per 3.1 million miles) than a standard automobile (1 per 500,000 miles) There were 474 accidents involving Teslas self-driving features from July 2021 to October 2022 resulting in 12 deaths (16 months). There are nearly 3,000,000 Teslas on the road today. Mathematically, theres barely a chance of this happening to anyone. This is just information without context, shoved in our faces to make us angry. Clickbait."
"Who the fuck is pushing a pram, through a traffic tunnel?"
"They should just call it ""Going Full Elon"""
Where those Musk simps at that were making excuses and saying this absolutely wasnt the case in the original threads? LMAO get wrekt
"Yeah, but Teslas are stupid junk cars."
"Were the 8 cars behind it also using FSD, because they had lots of time to stop"
[deleted]
Now imagine that in the beyond stupid hyperloop
Ok? and how many non auto driving cars got into accident that day?
"Tesla FSD is like a VR game where if you die in the game, you die IRL."
"Teslas awful FSD system requires one to pay attention and have their hand on the wheel so they can take over if something looks wrong... OK, well this accident was caused by the Tesla slamming on its brakes. How the fuck are you supposed to correct that?? Are you supposed to reach down and pull up on the brake pedal? That probably wouldnt do anything even if you could because of brake-by-wire. Are you supposed to smash on the accelerator pedal instead? Again, that probably wont work either because car brakes will overpower even the most powerful of motors. And Im sure software wouldnt allow it regardless."
"And in other news, the rest of the 19,000 wrecks that occur on an average day in the US had full human-driving engaged. Lol!"
I wish the government would hurry up and ban Tesla FSD. I didnt sign up to drive next to beta testers.
You mean the driver of the tesla.
"Tesla’s suck! Don’t take my word, read what consumer reports said."
I do hope the lawsuits will flow…
“This must’ve been the case in the November pileup crash on the I-80 east of the Bay Bridge in San Francisco. “ Meanwhile the title uses absolute terms. Only ~16000 users have FSD beta.
How is this still allowed to exist????
"If FSD is going to a thing, shouldn’t it be regulated?"
"I mean, its a beta and all. What do you expect?"
who did the police write the ticket too?
Maybe FSD should be banned entirely until they can prove it’s efficacy.
"Unfortunately, the driver was not engaged. Teslas FSD isnt bad. But its far from perfect. Its essential to stay engaged and be ready to take action at any time. If youre not willing to do that, dont use (abuse) the system. Youre putting lives at risk, including yours. End rant."
"For those who have a tesla with the auto drive engaged, you know you can just hit the accelerator if it does suddenly brake on you and it still keeps the car going. Hitting the accelerator while auto drive is engaged will speed your car up while still being in auto pilot mode. Ive had few moments where the car will randomly brake on me and I would have to hit the accelerator to bypass that random braking but it still keeps the car in autopilot without disengaging"
"Elizabeth Holmes must be so confused when she looks at Elon I mean, I also don’t understand why so many people love him, even though he too was faking the abilities of a supposedly revolutionary product, all to keep funding flowing in so he could hopefully get there one day. We are looking at a Theranos type situation, imo, at least in the underlying nature of it."
Another Elon failure.
"Stripping out the LIDAR sensors etc to cut costs, and then trying to do full self-driving, which nobody has yet manage to do 100% reliably *with all the sensors imaginable*.... what could go wrong? Realistically were probably still 20-30 years or more away from entirely autonomous driving. In fact, we shouldnt even bother, we should just build out skyTran everywhere and start retiring cars as a concept. With self-driving, since the computer has authority over the car even more so than the driver, when the computer goes haywire the driver cant do squat. I prefer my older car. With no autonomous anything..."
"Well the report is technically inaccurate. FSD does not operate on highways currently. The car had ‘enhanced autopilot’, EAP engaged."
"4DChessElonUltraBrainBattletechAITrainingMode: kill them meat, save the metal. This guy is okay with using his customers as beta testers in a life or death scenario. This is not a scientific experiment this is depravity."
Thank God this sort of thing never happens when the average idiot is driving themselves...
The fake “self driving” tech should be illegal.
Class action lawsuit against Tesla.
"Funny, I saw the video. The Tesla did come to a stop but it was not brakes locked, any other driver would have possibly and has done something similar. I say it was the people Speedo g behind that did not avoided it. But hey, let’s jump in the gate wagon and eat it up people, the media loves you."
The fact Tesla can put a system on the road or Boeing in the air with MCAS shows our method for validating the safety of emerging technology being integrated into our transportation infrastructure is seriously flawed - borderline non-existent.
Probably a reason behind the seemingly peaceful resignation of their lead in AI a few months back. I would guess that maybe it was going in a direction he wasnt comfortable with.
Why does the DOT allow this on the road? Seems as if Mayor Pete could easily ban Tesla Autopilot
"Every other car dealer is subject to massive recalls for even slight safety issues. Why isnt Tesla? A floor mat might get trapped in a certain way under the accelerator. Recall. FSD has been shown to cause multiple deaths. Hmm, give them more time to work out the bugs."
"Tesla should be shut down, obviously its a shit show of a company that does not deserve to be in business."
WHY ARE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES LETTING THESE FUCKING CARS OPERATE WITH THIS SOFTWARE INSTALLED?
"Our species is not there yet with this technology. Sure, on paper and in THEORY it is a great concept, thought out, and makes great sense if robots were behind the wheel 100% of the time. But there are way too many variables that impact road conditions and driver safety conditions. Not to mention having to sit in the vehicle for 30 minutes to get a charge when gas pumping takes 2-3 minutes. We are way behind on this tech and it’s going to take decades to get us to a comfy place with it. I’d rather us focus on fixing and improving all the infrastructure such as the power grid, water and sewer lines, communications and telephone poles… these things are so insecure and easy to hack and take out in an instant. We haven’t even begun to see what damage and crippling can happen if the tech we take for granted is automatically taken out on us. Self driving cars sounds like a cool idea but there are more important and pressing issues. Tesla was the first company to make this idea somewhat of a reality with lots of flaws and places to improve. And yeh, some lives will be lost in the trial and error stages of these new high tech innovations. But for me, I’m all for gas or finding sustainable synthetic gas vehicles. Keep the combustible engine and find ways to create synthetic gas that is cleaner and more efficient."
They were literally just forced by a lawsuit to admit that they staged their videos showing self driving working. Tesla’s ‘Autopilot’ is a fraud & we are the beta test.
Oh for fucks sake! It’s clearly not ready. Can everyone just stop using the self driving mode? Let Tesla fix this shut over time and do the ducking driving yourself! How many times does this need to happen before people learn.
We are literally Tesla’s r&d department. We are crash test dummies live-testing their self-driving mode…for free. Genius business decision.
And how many global pileups were caused by fully human engaged drivers this month?
Did y’all read about how the autopilot video at launch was faked
"Oh gee, another Tesla crashing into and hurting people, but can’t blame Tesla, after all, you agreed to the terms and conditions of use. Such bullshit. This company and it’s crap cars are good for no one."
I see Elons douchey face whenever I read articles like this.
Easy to identify The idiots that own the tent cars in the thread.
"If only there were some kind of way to put cars on rails, so that there was less for the computer to calculate. Maybe grade separate it where you can, and inside of cities it can go at reasonable speeds and have the right of way. You could make it big, so that a bunch of people could share one, which would reduce the space needed for vehicles in general. Maybe it can make predetermined stops at particular locations, so that it can pick up and let off people as needed. You could even run electrical cables along with the rail so that the vehicles dont need to carry super heavy batteries. Oh, wait, this is all just called trains, trams, subways, etc. Its basic public transport in most of the developed world."
"Sigh not this CNN article that doesn’t say at all they have info from NTSH. Still NTSH hasn’t published any findings… ontop of that this isn’t FSD, it’s a freeway where autopilot drives. So we still don’t know what happened"
"Honest question: Assuming that this accidents fault lies in the tech, would it be fair to say that even at this early stage in the tech or system, it is still overall safer than a human driver? Its relative of course, but if you turn all cars into auto drivers and compare to 1990 numbers, it HAS to be magnitudes (not literally) better....not to say this shouldnt happen, but were making steps in the right direction, yes?"
"The driver is at fault, not the car. The person came to a full stop or else fully let the car do it without any intervention! There is not a single driver on FSD who can say that this is a thing that just happens, the car fully stopping despite the driver’s input. This is like the stories of people who followed their gps in broad daylight into a lake or something. You either have to completely ignore several very loud warnings or else not be paying ANY attention to whatever contrary decision the AI is making. This isn’t about standing up for FSD, it’s about acknowledging that (1) the DRIVER chose to opt in, (2) the DRIVER chose to engage, (3) the DRIVER chose to ignore everything around him. The driver is blaming FSD for his own complete lack of attention."
Selling my Tesla and Tesla stock
"I watched the video - what was the guy doing, jerking off? No way he lets his car come to a complete stop in the fast lane like that if he’s paying attention."
"The Tesla can stop as hard as it wants, the people behind it need to be in control of their own cars. This means driving at a safe speed and giving yourself enough space to stop in an emergency. This is not the fault of the Tesla. But let’s say it was. Tesla: 1 Humans: 99999999…"
My only comment is if he had just turned on the self driving why was he so slow to over ride it? Why let the car go all the way to 7 miles per hour? Both at fault I think.
It’s crazy I was just over in r/tesla and they are saying it’s all fake news and it was the drivers fault. No proof of fsd stack or something they are coping hard.
The wrap is 🔥 and I dont say this often
"Ive been driving a Tesla Model 3 2021 SR+ for the last 2 years! However this is my first time purchasing my own Tesla. Considered getting a Tesla Model S but found they simply arent anywhere near as good from a value for money perspective! In the end I found this Tesla Model 3 SR+ 2020 with only 35k miles on the odometer with plenty of warranty and brand new set of tires. The car was also wrapped in Satin Dark Grey by the original owner which is still in great condition. Additionally, the rear windows have been tinted, its had a full chrome delete and the headlights and rear lights have also been tinted. I think its an amazing time to get a used Tesla in the UK with all the negative market forces at play. How much do you think its worth/ how much do you think I paid for it?"
"generally I find silver wraps to be horribly boring, but for some reason this one looks very nice."
That is a NICE color.
Beautiful color. 🔥
Very nice! May I ask how many mileage your 80% and 100% charge is?
"If I ever get a Plaid, this is the exact color I’m wrapping it "
Silver Surfer! It’s beautiful. :-)
How much to get that wrap done? Color name?
Congrats she’s beautiful
"Your 3 looks great, a really nice bit of kit! I have a Model Y on order in Midnight Silver Metalic and will be doing the XPEL Stealth PPF, so it should look very similar."
Like!
That looks absolutely amazing! Breathtaking look!
An actual wrap that I want to see more photos of.
That wont fit in your garage
This should be a stock option.
That hoe clean
"That damn QC put your steering wheel on the wrong side, but apart from that, she is a beauty."
You are going to love it! Its life changing never to have to go to a gas station again!
[removed]
In addition to your car having great style your garage and drive way is so cute I’m jealous
"What is the floor of that wrap, looks sick!!"
Who designed that garage that is smaller than a car?
What trim?
Yeah that wrap looks fucking sick in that lighting. Any chance you know which one it is? Guessing 3m satin dark grey. If I’m wrong I’d love to check out what you have!
Can you post profile photos
"I’m very curious, did you buy it for the Tesla inventory? If so, what color option was it under?"
"First time seeing one that looks anything like mine. I’m a huge fan of the wrap and, like you, I likely wouldn’t have done it myself, but so happy to get one that had it done beforehand. Do you know what the wrap is? Different pictures can show varying things, but I was curious if it is in fact the same as mine. Great looking car! This is my M3 LR "
Do you know the wrap colour?
How come you still have USS? Is this a 2023 model?
Awesome styling on the M3! Does it fit in the little garage though? 🤣
Oh shit. They screwed up. The steering wheel is on the wrong side. :-)
That wrap got it looking like a Porsche... Nice job

"They brought a plaid to our facility to let some of us test out after the big release. The videos really don’t do it justice, it’s unreal to accelerate as fast the plaid does."
"The first amazing thing is that this is without drama, or noise, or lots of money for complex and expensive maintenance. The second amazing thing is the German drivers. They use their mirrors and ***pay attention***"
4.19 second 100-200kph Ranked #9 on autotopNLs chart. The only cars that beat it are some modified 1000+HP cars. Pretty insanse.
Client took me for a demo “ride” in new Plaid. Testicular! Shoved my balls out my asshole.
 267 KMH
"I have a Plaid. The acceleration is ludicrous+. It pushes your organs to the back of your body. It makes your stomach sink. It injured my girlfriends neck because she didnt properly brace her head. I cleaned dishes for a week after introducing her to the acceleration of that beast. Not that I dont clean dishes; my dishwashing machine does it, but that particular week it was out of service. I digress. The Plaid is my favorite piece of tech. So cool."
Id like to see what sort of range it has while going its top speed...for science
Remember when Tesla announced it will do 200mph? Pepperidge Farm remembers… Also they should have put it in track mode for 175 at least.
Its an electric car. Any top speed would be electronically limited 😂
"Been up to 115-120mph in my X Plaid, thatll do donkey, thatll do. Its really quite boring tbh once you get used to it. Its just like ""meh, okay, Ill do it, done"". My 01 5spd Civic back in the F&F days was a bit more engaging, even though soccer moms in their mini-vans could destroy me off the line :)"
Speed limits need to be 100mph in murica...freeways i guess
Man that’s insane! And I thought the 0-60 in my M3P was crazy fast. The Tesla center service advisor told me that the Plaid acceleration actually makes your head scramble after a few times lol.
what a time to be alive.
How long will the Plaid be sold before it can hit the top speed listed in its marketing material?
Mph on the Autobahn?!? Please use km/h.
It should have 3 calipers per wheel.
Did anyone get to see the 100-200kph?
Why is this in r/all with so few votes?
Absolutely ridiculously awesome! I Turo’d a M3P and just cackled maniacally when I finally got to the point where I trusted myself to fully floor it. I can only imagine how crazy a plaid is when the M3P blew my mind with what I thought a car could do acceleration wise.
Can someone convert this to real world figures? I dont understand the length of a hair and two long yards of measurements
What happened to the 200 miles per hour claim?
"More like 11-12 seconds max. When he floored it from a dead stop at 0:49, he was already slowing down to 255kmph at the 1:13 mark."
Did anyone know where you can purchase a yoke steering cover?

I posted this in teslamodely the other day. I’m a massive crash nerd. Been studying crashes over 20 years. I was waiting for this moment. The model y (22- and up) is the safest car in the world. No car has ever aced side impact 2.0. And it did it with a -30. structure score which is absurdly good. The model Y annihilates the Volvo XC90. The only car within spitting distance of an overall perfect score combined with super strong structure is the Rivian R1T
Consumer Reports Number 1 Vehicle to not commit a murder-suicide in.
Anyone has questions on side impact 2.0 let me know I’ve been studying it since it was being studied in beta
"Nearly perfect? Headline: ""Tesla fails to ace key crash tests. When safe is not safe enough."""
How does the model Y keep hitting scores like this while simultaneously getting removed from the consumer reports recommended list? I guess it’s off the charts safe but falls off of the recommendation list due to a low reliability score.
"Great, but has the 2023 Austin built Model Y with structural pack been tested yet. I do not think so. I want to know how that fairs."
Just love that dark red Model Y! Just beautiful!
"Were not saying to drive it off a cliff. Were just saying if you were to drive off a cliff, youd want to do it in one of these."
How does this compare to a m3?
Tesla should have more active safety features and not just rely on strong crash ratings. Mitigating the risk of an accident is far better than being in an accident. We don’t even have rear cross traffic alerts which can protect people around the car and not just inside.
Does the federal tax credit expire after march 2023 or is it honored if the delivery date changes ?
"Im honestly tired of hearing of the safety of Teslas. Been hearing it for years. I want to see ""Tesla drastically improves overall build quality at no increased cost to the consumer to keep up with the competition."""
If they could improve their service they would dominate on an even larger scale.
I just wish it was standard in other cars - Ive had my Model 3 for only \~6 months and this was just heartbreaking!
"Im sorry OP this happened to you, but that second vehicle pushing the first one away to hit you too gave me a chuckle. That second driver wasnt paying attention to the road at all."
"This is exactly why you shouldnt keep just a cars distance between another car on the highway. You should keep like, at least, 3 car distance or more. I literally dont trust cars in front of me on the highway."
Oh man... 😞
"For 3 seconds distraction at 50 mi/h you will travel 220 feet so one second is about 73 feet... Drivers need to keep their eyes on the road in front of them all the time! Too many drivers are tailgating, too many drivers are not paying attention, we see this daily."
"Just curious, who is at fault here?"
"It doesnt look like the car in front braked for no reason, there were other cars stopped in front of them, which you can see when one of the cars pulls into the right lane afterwards. It looks like you had plenty of time to react but werent paying attention."
Too bad Tesla driver wasnt more aware as there was room in either lane & could have avoided this.
"Incoming backseat drivers comments in 3,2,1. Emergency braking did what it had to do with success. The problem is the stupid human following behind not paying attention and ramming the back of the Tesla."
Well thats what I call brake check
"This is one of biggest fear. You don’t have to really worry about the car in front, it’s the car in back of you, you have to worry about."
"That stinks that this happened to you. The person at fault is the car behind you. You maintained 3 seconds of spacing between you and the car ahead of you. The car behind you was maintaining 1 second of spacing. In addition, since his car is several years old, I’m sure his brakes are shit to boot, requiring him to keep more spacing."
Such an idiot in car... r/idiotsincars
"Hm. You can not even press charges against the driver, which significantly slowed down. Cars behind need to leave a distance. If the proper space is not kept, its their problem. Sadly the idiots behind you were texting or not going enough distance."
If it is indeed autopilot then why didnt it immediately take the right lane?
Defensive driving course could’ve save him.
"The people behind you are completely at fault.. idk why he hit the brakes but you had enough time to react and not hit him, they shouldve given themselves the same time"
"well you know that it is almost always the driver who rear end the others is fault, no matter why/how fast the driver in front stops. that is why you need to keep safe driving distance."
Reminds me of this time I saw a lady break for some ducks on the lane to the right of her only to cause a 3 car accident.
""
Looks like the car in front of them stopped short too. Brake lights in left lane also. Ppl behind you 💯 at fault.
I use 6 car distance on autopilot but I feel ya pain got my first Tesla totaled by 18 wheeler
"Doesnt look like abruptly braking, looks like traffic in front of the learner was stopped."
This is exactly why the 3 second gap rule exists….. but almost no one follows it.
Just asking how truly reliable is autopilot. The title means that autopilot did the braking alone right? You werent pressing on the pedal?
"This is why I wish Tesla hadn’t removed the radar function. They seem to be bringing it back with new radar equipment. When I first tried AP on my 2018 Model 3, one of the most amazing features was the car braking for slow/stopped vehicles that I couldn’t even see. Sometimes my car would brake before the car I was following activated it’s brake lights. I recall thinking ‘what the heck is AP doing?’ and then watching the distracted car in front of me SLAM it’s brakes on late. And I would never hit it, because AP had already preemptively begun to reduce my speed. It was amazing! And the cars behind me were already slowing too, reacting to me. I understand the desire to make FSD run entirely from camera data, to mimic humans. But if the goal is to be better than a human, features like radar are a no brainer to me."
 Was this 100% the car handling the braking?

And in Denmark..
EV is simply a better product than a combustion vehicle.
Shoot I thought I was special with mine in upstate ny..
"Looks like at the end of the day product availability, quality and desirability + price price price PRICE! are what matters. Everything else is a side show"
# HMM VERY STRANGE I DONT SEE THIS ON /R/NEWS I WONDER WHY
So all their pissing and moaning about Elon on Twitter didnt work? Weird....
"It must really, really burn CNBC to report this. In CA of all places.. Isn’t the media been telling people Elon=Baaad?"
"When Apple had a CEO who was a nozzle, nobody avoided Apple because consumers viewed the products as decent. The same goes for tesla. (I think apple is terrible in terms of serviceability or cost, but can personally vouch for the reliability of EVs). For those down voting me:  "
"The dudes in the thumbnail don’t look exceptionally happy about it, lol."
There are so many white tesla here in Cali. So bland.
So much brand damage /s
"fun, keep them out of the fast lane while using AP on SoCal highways."
"Isn’t California one of the worst places for an EV? Gas prices are pretty much the highest in the country, but electricity prices are miles above neighboring states. Like 300%-500-% higher in many parts. 2 electric car household in Arizona here with 10 cents/kWh ."
"Really not saying much. Pretty much every other manufacture is so unfathomably back-logged, new car options are slim to non-existent. Delivery estimates are frequently in the **years**, still to this day. That applies to both ICE and EVs. Meanwhile, demand for Tesla so low right now comparatively, its one of the few new vehicles you can take delivery in weeks. Im sure the has been a god-send for keeping sales up."
"EVs are fun to drive, but until they save money they will be just a ""toy"". New tires every 25k miles, purchase price 10-15k premium, charging station at home 2k, double the insurance cost, extra road fees (in VA extra $120 per year for the registration). Add a low resale value based on 16k battery replacement cost and it is hard to call EV anything else than expensive but fun toy"
no surprise with this new.
Y?
La Croix.
Just ordered mine yesterday. First time Tesla owner. Any advice would be appreciated!

"That red hue on the new lenses is indicative of anti-glare coating. I periodically get a warning on my Model 3s screen that a camera is unusable due to glare, when the sun is at a low angle and perpendicular to the side of the car."
The field of view on that new side repeater camera must be pretty wide given the angle it faces vs the old unit. I wonder what that’s going to look like for turn signal video? Maybe they crop the video for that use?
No new additional camera spotted but the new side repeaters should help a lot (backwards compatible?). 
Those $10K price cuts on inventory Model X were an obvious sign that this was imminent. That TESLA decal looks like an Aliexpress mod tho
"I always removed the ""Model S"" badge on my Teslas (awful typeface), but the missing ""T"" aint it for me personally. Also red caliper *covers* is a huge embarrassment on the Plaid."
Looks like they maybe brought the center horn back to the steering wheel too. No horn icon (or any icons) by thumb wheel.
Is that a rain sensor or did model x / s not ever get rid of that sensor compared to 3 / y? Edit: or maybe ambient light sensor
How is no one going ape shit that they cheaped out on the brakes for one of the fastest cars on the planet.
This doesn’t make sense. The Hw4 computer leak based on the clearly showed pcb silkscreen annotation indicating cameras in the front fender.
Goddamnit; still no matrix headlights for the Model X.
Looks like those fenders might fix the blind spot for cross traffic (that people insist Tesla engineers would never be so dumb so as to overlook and therefore couldnt possibly exist).
Wonder if they updated IO interfaces
Me: “The advantage of Tesla is they can make huge improvements by just updating software” Tesla: replaces hardware to achieve better results Me: …..
"Looking good... sad I cant upgrade my legacy, but [thats just the way she goes]( :/ I like the removal of the emblems and the new T E S L A lettering... looks easier to keep clean."
I really wish they would have windshield wiper sprayers like the old Volvo headlights did. In the winter the cameras get black pretty quick.
FSD buyers still thinking they’re getting it ![img](emote|t5_2s3j5|17555)
I like the removal of the Tesla emblem. Looks slicker.
When Model 3?
All this stuff must be coming to Model 3/Y
Who would buy the s or x without uss
"If Im buying a Plaid , Im getting premium calipers. What the fuck."
Steering wheel production has begun yes
Will the offer to replace the cameras on the newer model 3/y?
Whats the consensus on the yoke steering wheel? Do people like it or prefer the traditional wheel?
"Sweet, when’s my retrofit ?"
Nice
[removed]
I don’t see sensors/USS on these pics on the bumpers! Tesla family look!
looks like there is a rain sensor on the windshield. do the old ones even have one or is it all managed by the camera?
I just got my car and now wish I either waited a few months or could upgrade. :/
Would be interesting to just put a HW4 cam on a HW3 car... The module must be the same size. Maybe even the same harness? Well see once they are available in the EPC

Surprised Tesla hasnt made a Model Y Standard+ for the Canadian market to take advantage of the tax credit.
M3 is 45k after incentive in Québec MY is 72k no incentive available This make the jump from 3 to Y 27k

"Of course, Finns, Swedes and Norwegians have been habitually driving to the Arctic Ocean on a number of different electric vehicles and all seasons for years; just on the other side of the sea in the mythical land of Europe. So the headline should add ""in the American continent"" to be more accurate. This is of course quite a bit more complicated in America, because of the lack of population and infrastructure, so Im not criticizing the accomplishment - just the inaccuracy of the headline!"
Wouldn’t a model s get you ever more easier with more range?
"From the article: Jonathan Zoes, an aspiring filmmaker, has become the first person to drive an electric vehicle to the Arctic Ocean in -40°C (-40°F) temperatures of an Arctic winter, and he did it in a Tesla Model Y. Zoes documented his journey driving through Canada to Tuktoyaktuk, relying on the help of strangers to plug in the vehicle once charging stations became harder to find. In an interview with Northern News Services Limited, Zoes stated that finding charging stations was easy in the southern part of his drive. However, as he made his way to Dawson Creek in Northern British Columbia, he had to rely on RV parks to keep his vehicle charged. The Yukon territory has been constructing fast charging stations at an impressive rate, even surpassing the adoption rate of electric vehicles among locals. Consequently, Zoes found most of the charging stations empty after passing Whitehorse. Zoes couldn’t always rely on finding public chargers however. An Indigenous council in Profit River let him use their maintenance building for the night to charge up. To cross the Dempster Highway, which has no gas stations for more than 300 kilometres, he befriended road crews who let him use their garages. In Fort McPherson, he was able to get another charge from LJ’s Contracting. To travel the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktyuk Highway, he improvised a charging station."
"What kind of ranges was he getting up there from a charge, and how long did he have to charge it on other peoples electricity. Im guessing they didnt have wall charges mounted, and hes relying on the mobile connector ~3kW/hr charge rate?"
What does it matter…these cold temps kill the battery 🪫 so fast
So the 300 some mile range is now down to actually 50 miles got it
How many times did they stop to charge it? It’s down to 50F here and I swear my battery is now at half capacity
"This looks very similar to [another accident in China]( that happened three months ago. The discussions here back then also mentioned the possibility of pedal confusion or panic acceleration, but just like here, the acceleration was over an extended period and distance, with the driver still steering. That doesnt mean its not an accident caused by panic, but its a bit... odd."
Handles well
New FSD update is 🔥
Floor mat on accelerator
Out of control? Obviously someone is steering it.
That thing that never happens sure is happening a lot lately.
Look at ALL those vehicles it didn’t strike! It saves lives!
I deleted this earlier because I thought it was a repost
Again?
Wild guess... long shot possibility. Large metal water bottle fell into drivers leg area and got wedged between the brake and accelerator.
Studies have shown it to be true so i understand its most likely the case but my god how dies this happen this often 😂 and why is it always teslas??
"Back in the 80s at the peak of the Audi unintended acceleration hype, there was one car where the driver swore up and down that she was standing on the brake pedal with all of her weight and the car continued at full throttle. When they investigated her car, they found the tip of the gas pedal had actually been bent shed been stepping on it so hard. When people are certain theyre applying the brakes and the expected result doesnt occur, once panic sets in theyre very unlikely to assess the situation. Instead, theyll almost certainly continue doing what theyre doing, sure that theyre applying the correct pedal."
Idiots putting aftermarket floor mats in their cars
I remember when a CHP officer (off duty) killed his family in a accident when the floor mat jammed on the gas pedal. Maybe that prompted Toyota into putting in a limit on AEB and user inputs? After that a few people took their Toyotas out and jammed the gas pedal (intentional) and wrecked trying to claim insurance money (they didnt die). I know enough to know not to judge based off no real information. I seriously doubt the car did this on its own though.
More like out of control driver.
Driver banned by r\\Tesla and r\\elonmusk already
Within spec
"The flair is quite macabre ""owner experience"" Now no way this was pedal confusion, not a chance in hell I will believe this, this lasted for too long. Either the car accelerated itseld due to software error(making musk a murderer, plain and simple) or the driver had a death wish. There is no 3rd option, unless I am wrong. Take these things off my streets, Jesus Christ. Recall the lot of them."
There are rumours about a new Tesla blue abonnement. Without this abo the brakes wont work anymore.
"I would think that with all that neural net stuff etc. that the car would know where it is, i.e. in a downtown area, that 80mph would not be an appropriate speed, and would not let the car DO it. When I saw videos of Tesla owners auto summoning their cars in parking lots full of pedestrians etc. it made me want to scream as they played with their dangerous toys around human beings."
Stupid dumb Tesla. Eat crow you piece of trash
"1-pedal driving gone wrong + panic = accelerator all the way down? This should be labelled nsfw, a guy standing by a car is clearly dead at the end."
Ban Tesla now!!
Propaganda video with maximum impact
"Pedal confusion doesn’t usually last this long and allow someone to maintain steering control and cognition. This just looks like a car problem, most likely. I always default to pedal confusion, but this looks convincing."
"looks like the engine controller was stuck or hacked at full power. i think Teslas have AC motors. With DC motor as in the crappiest or old EVs, there is one more possibility, blown transistor and relay stuck, that will apply full power to the motor until battery is dead or disconnected."
"The guy went crazy, life in communism is weird, unimaginable things can be done to you at work or home, people you thought were close to you including lovers turn out to be informers, he learned re-education a.k.a. labor camp is in the works, etc. etc."
"In all cars today, whether gas, diesel, or battery, the accel pedal is just an ""electronic request"". In olden days (until \~2010), the accel pedal was directly actuated either a cable or rod which controlled either a throttle plate in the inlet or an injection pump. The electronic signal can get corrupted or read wrong in software. In early systems in gas cars, the throttle plate was moved directly (via motor) in synch with the accel pedal, but not sure that is still true today, such as the controller may lift up the throttle during transmission shifts. Teslas response has typically been ""the log shows the accel pedal was pressed"", but that doesnt mean the driver pressed the pedal or that it was even depressed. In one posted case, the data from a Tesla showed the pedal being depressed and lifted 10 times per sec, which a human driver couldnt do, looking more like either electronic glitches or incorrect software reading of bytes."
The stereotypes just write themselves
I don’t believe anything reported from China
Amazing how the accelerator won’t stop the car.
Funny only the chines can make a car acidente with a car that can drive it self
Did anybody ask the car about what happened.
Medical situation? Similar incident happened a few months back in China except even worse. I think the reason was medical issue? Can someone please correct me
Driver died? Or someone in the bus?
"Insert anti China, Chyna bad, China cheats, rhetoric. That will fix it!"
No E brake?
BYD fucking with teslas in China 👎.
"I’m surprised the car didn’t shut down after that nose dive. I remember a Model S Plaid doing something similar and the guy said the car shut off pretty much immediately. Granted, that thing literally flew through the air. Regardless, looked like the little 3 got enough air to atleast cause some sort of impact on landing."
Fast n FURIOUS
"I don’t get what’s so strange, they be driving like that over here in the states too🤪"
"Definitely not caused by the car but nice try, OP"
Remember when you could just switch a key and turn off the ignition?
Didnt I read that holding the park button will quickly decelerate the car?
I doubt pedal confusion because the driver was doing an impressive job of avoiding other cars. My thinking is a floor mat that slid forward impacting both pedals.
"Literally this could have been any car, not just Tesla 😂😂"
I guess the stereotypes are true
This video will only encourage more young bros to buy a Tesla. Closest thing to GTA in real-life.
You have arrived at your destination.
This could be as simple as a displaced floor mat. We had a situation with a Honda Fit where a valet driving our car slipped the mat up and it trapped the gas pedal in the down position causing him to slam the car into a wall in the parking garage. After submitting this to insurance we found out its a surprisingly common occurance.
"The passenger was like nope, im out lol"
So the investigation has concluded that the driver was pressing the wrong pedal 100% of the time and the brake pedal was never engaged. People panic Just an FYI at how dumb these clickbait articles are. Id be happy to link if anyone is interested

Is the one in the foreground an old electric car?
Had a blast at Peterson. Awesome display of cars. 🚗💨
the gui was horrible though. looks very 90s winamp
I’ll have the blue and white one in the back plz
Now with TILLER steering~!
Was there a few weeks back. Great display
Shouldve stuck with the Aston rear
The prototype looks much like the lucid air (in the rear). I got something very similar on my desk. [ Definitely a lot smaller.
"I really like the model S, its just too expensive for me, well, everything is, I dont even own a tesla but if I did it would be a model 3."
Looks like the current ugly lucid air glad they didn’t ship this…
Is that an MC12 in the back?
Is that a vertical screen inside again?
I love that red so much
"I mean, anything thats being shown at a museum of some kind is gonna look spotless. Sooo 🤷"
"> Am Tesla Model 3 ergaben sich auch relativ häufig Bemängelungen an den Bremsscheiben. Solche Mängel treten bei allen untersuchten E-Autos überdurchschnittlich häufig auf, erklärt Joachim Bühler, Geschäftsführer des TÜV-Verbands. ""Ein Grund dafür ist die Rekuperation, mit der in E-Autos Bremsenergie zurückgewonnen wird. Sie entlastet die Bremsen, was abhängig von der Fahrweise zum Einschlafen der Bremsbeläge (Absenkung des Reibwertes) führen kann."" Daher sollten E-Auto-Fahrende regelmäßig kräftig bremsen, um die Bremsbeläge wieder zu regenerieren und damit die volle Bremsleistung zu erhalten. Vielleicht kommt es ja noch, dass einen das Auto daran erinnert. Ist ja kein Problem aber ich würde definitiv vergessen einmal im Monat (oder in der Woche?) scharf zu bremsen."
"Tesla hat halt keine periodische Wartung, das fällt halt auf. Bei den Autos wo es die gibt macht man die typischerweise direkt vom TÜV"
"Was mir bei Teslas in letzter Zeit immer mehrbj auffällt, daß es „Blender“ sind. Brennen einem gefühlt, Löcher in die Netzhaut, wegen falsch eingestellten Licht. Danke Elon, ist echt unangenehm."
"Die die jetzt über den TÜV müssen, sind ja frühe Modelljahre, und die wurden bekanntermaßen schlecht in den USA zusammengedengelt. Würde mich interessieren, wie es bei den aktuellen Modellen aus China und Deutschland ausschaut, in der Produktion sind die deutlich besser. An billigen Lagern ändert das natürlich nix. Ich bin mal gespannt, wie die Statistik in 2-3 Jahren aussieht."
"Amis können keine Autos bauen, die westlichen Standards entsprechen. Überraschung."
Mein ehemaliger Golf Hybrid war da auch nicht besser. Nach zwei Jahren waren hinten die Scheiben wegen nicht-Benutzung total vergammelt.
"Und der Polestar z.B. sieht auch noch wesentlich geiler aus, wenn einem Posing wichtig ist. Ansonsten gibt es ja kaum noch vernünftige Gründe, ausgerechnet ein Musk-Mobil zu kaufen."
"Bei einem Auto welches nicht in einen teuren jährlichen Service muss sammeln sich natürlich kleinere Mängel z.B. bei der Beleuchtung an, die dann eben vom TÜV entdeckt werden. Das ist praktisch eine Verlagern der Prüfarbeit und für den Halter eine angenehme Sache."
Ist das ne neuhigkeit? ist doch seit Jahren klar dass Tesla scheiße darin ist Autos zu bauen

"Is that a state tax credit directly going towards income tax, or do you just get all of it regardless of if you pay income tax? Oregon also doesn’t have sales tax on vehicles (or really anything) so that also makes them cheaper."
"California has the same deal, but you have to game your income across multiple years to make it fully work. State related credit requires low income. Federal rebate requires enough tax liability."
"Kind of misleading. To get the 5k charge ahead credit you need to drop below a pretty low income threshold. Based on household size. 54k individual, 73k for a couple, 92k for three. At those rates you’re not going to have $7,500 in taxes to claim the credit against to begin with."
How’s the model 3 rear wheel drive? I wanna buy one but living in north east not sure how good it will be in rain or snow. I have a all wheel drive car if weather is bad but that’s like 10 days out of the year. The range is about 50-75miles less than performance. I wanna get one but debating if I’ll regret the lease.
"We see headlines like this, the general public sees ""Thinking about getting a Tesla? The $20,000 battery replacement cost may make you think twice."" (When in reality the batteries are warrantied for far longer than any ICE vehicle). We see headlines like ""Tesla owners save $1,000+ in gas each year by charging at home."" The general public sees ""Tesla owners in Texas are forbidden from charging their cars in Texas."" (When in reality we just got a popup asking us to consider charging during off-peak hours due to a heatwave.) We see headlines like ""Tesla owners leave their house with a fully charged battery every day."" The general public sees ""Teslas take 10x longer to refuel than gas cars do."" (When in reality Supercharging is usually the exception to refueling rather than the norm for the majority of owners.) We see headlines like ""Tesla receives highest safety record ever given by NHTSA."" The general public sees ""Tesla bursts into flames after accident."" (When in reality Teslas catch fire less frequently than gas cars.) We see headlines like ""Tesla fixes issue through OTA."" The general public sees headlines like ""Tesla recalls millions of vehicles across the country."" (When in reality issuing a recall for a problem like this is a required formality more than anything else.) We live in different realities and it shows in some of the interactions you have with people on the street. ""All fun and games until you gotta spend $20k to get a new battery!"" ""How much ya like the government telling you you cant charge your car?"" ""Yeah, they look nice but I aint willing to wait 45 minutes to fill up every time."" ""Arent ya afraid that things gonna explode on ya? Those things arent safe."" ""Wont that self-driving thing drive you into a wall?"""
"Very nice for low-moderate income families. But I suspect your average tesla shopper isnt eligible for the $5k portion of the check. It seems pretty restrictive. A maximum $120k household income for [a family of five.]( Again, super nice for those who qualify."
"Can confirm, buying EV in Oregon is stupid cheap."
Cries in Iowan
What the article fails to mention is that you have to be low or moderate income to get that extra $5000.
"LMAO this post is so dumb. First off, youre paying $43,490. The only way to collect the full $15k from both federal and state tax incentives is to make just enough money to qualify for both. Youd have to make $54,013.63- $58,320/year to get the full amount and even then youre still paying $28,490. This is because the federal income tax credit requires that you make at least $54,013.63 to have enough tax liability to qualify and Oregon only gives their full refundable tax credit to those making less than $58,320. Secondly, theyre just copying Californias EV credit. $2500 to upper class, $7500 to middle/lower class."
I live in Oregon!
"Oregon is sweet.. if I had to live in the USA, I would probably choose Oregon."
"Controversial opinion: we dont need tax credits or incentives for EVs anymore. Theyre selling like hotcakes as it is. What we need is investment in battery manufacturing, so we can build more EVs and bring the price down to what average people can afford, and we need investment in charging infrastructure so people who dont own single-detached homes with garages can charge them."
[deleted]
At that price you can buy 2. 1 to drive while the other is in the shop. My tesla store is jam packed full of broken cars. Even have the parking lot labeled tow in zone and the tow trucks just leave them everywhere blocking traffic lol.
So I cant just drive down from Olympia and get one...
Nice
Only worth maybe 8k these are cheap and ugly cars
"Meanwhile, Germany is already phasing out the EV incentives, where there is now a fixed budget for it and if that’s used up, that’s it… so that I have no idea if I will even get anything for it. Might have to pay the full price or €58k myself."
Nice
"The federal tax credit does not apply to the price of the vehicle, your payments will be the same price. All it does is allow you to change your taxable income rate to account for up to $7500 on next years taxes. Theres talk that next year it could be applied directly to the purchase price of the car but it will be lower."

EVs in general for Urban Police Departments are a no brainer. The range is more then sufficient for a shift.
Im 90% sure the calculation is comparing to the price of two explorers since they estimated needing to be replaced every 5 years.
"Today on ""Shit Bargersville Indiana Has Been Telling Us for Years""."
uses a lot less fuel and energy when theyre idling and playing on their cell phones
I shared a post from the police department about this on a local city FB page (in Wisconsin) and the degree of ignorance on EVs in the comments was just staggering. Seeing how widespread this ignorance is makes me realize how suppressed the demand for EVs still is. If even half of the people who still believe the misinformation were to live with an EV for a month the Model Y wait times would be out to 2025.
"Remember that the government still pays taxes on fuel that is used, and also pay taxes on electricity, even though those taxes go back to central government and might get returned to the police department in a future budget. Economists differ on whether government departments should be excluded from taxes paid back to the government. Some say that it is economically inefficient to do so, because it leads to worse decisionmaking."
Want that brush guard
That’s enough to pay 4 officer’s yearly salaries here in south GA!
Time to go to Somerset and get arrested for the free Tesla ride
Lol if Im a criminal just have to drive for 300 or so miles and Im home free lmfao 🤪
That’s not a lot. Even less than not a lot if that isn’t per car. E: The 84k savings is per car compared to a hybrid. Not as bad as I was thinking with that competition. Shame on me for not reading such a short article first.
"I work in this field. But because my job is so polarizing on Reddit, I will leave it at that. On a typical shift we average somewhere between 80-130 miles. And burn through about 9-11 gallons of fuel. We buy fuel in bulk and fill up at the fleet office. My agency was able to buy around 400 Ford Explorers during our last bid for about $24k a piece. This is the base cost, before retrofitting. We retire a patrol vehicle at around 200k miles or more depending upon many factors. Most cars are still running just fine but are typically on a new engine and on their third transmission. At that mileage however, the interiors and structural components are very destroyed. Lots of interior trim is broken or missing. The cars rattle like crazy and suspensions are clunky and terrible. Because of the wear and tear alone I couldnt imagine driving a ten year old patrol vehicle as aggressively as is sometimes done. Let alone in a pursuit for extended periods of time for over 110 mph. Theyre proverbial shit boxes by year six."
How is Tesla lasting 10 years for them and the explorers only 5? That seems to be driving the overall savings estimate but sounds like a big assumption.
I’m guessing the savings will be gone when they factor in more frequent tire changes. Idk how long tires last on the explorer but man do I burn through tires.
Just 2 dents and those savings are gone...
[removed]
We all know they want Teslas because they are fast enough to catch a speeder easily so they can write more tickets lol
Cybertruck will be the police cruiser of the future.
Its a great idea until they see the turn around time for body parts after an off duty officer is driving drunk and plows it into a parked car on the side of the road.
Whats with the blue lives flag? They might as well put a Nazi flag. Non official badges on publicly funded vehicles should be illegal.
"Probably not. Buying these to run into the ground, rather than trade in is going to result in a ton of $10,000 new battery bills that the tax payer will end up eating."
There must be very low crime where this exists or not gangland. How is this supposed to do back to back chases on murder suspects driving V8s? The cost saving isn’t going to save lives.
"Id be more impressed if it was an actual police package. Beefier suspension components, dressed down interior and smaller screen with knobs for HVAC, etc... The one thing that would make me hesitate is how it handles a rear ending by someone doing 60+ mph. If it damages the battery and causes a fire then its even more dangerous than the old Crown Victorias with the gas tank puncture issue. _________ There is so much much fuel to be saved in non-patrol fleet vehicles being converted to electric. Those vehicles wouldnt need any extra modifications for ease of use or longevity."
"If they dont charge from 20-80%, I cant see those batteries lasting more than 5 years... if they dont end up spontaneously combusting. Not to mention all the glitches. But, lets try it out when it comes to public safety"
They’ll spend the money on military grade weaponry and tech to “keep people safe”
"I remember thinking teslas were the green future when I was in high school. Amazing to see them just supporting all the old power structures, what a mind fuck."
"I love Teslas but I don’t think EVs are suited for taxi and police applications. Imagine if your cops says sorry my battery has ran out, I will be back after 30 minutes of supercharging…"
...but it clearly will not. At least one major system will be offline half the time. Cost to repair will be far higher than otherwise and theyll need a new battery within 5 years. How many miles per day does a standard police cruiser do?
Nice! But I’m assuming the repairs/body work is more expensive?
One of the cool features will be nearby donut shops will show up on the navigation map 🍩
"I never see police keeping cars for 10 years in my area, usually seems like 5 or 6..."
You can outrun with MYP
Yeah the wear on that battery will definitely not be kind
Love it!!
84k in 10years lol
Good luck repairing it after an accident or intentional collision ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)
Which pit move bumper is that? I want it for my Y.
Bet they didn’t take repair costs into account.
Make sure you switch to % and battery degradation is normal 🙂 Congrats on your car! Youll love it
"For every 1000 good experiences, there is 1 thread. For every 1 bad experience, there is 1 thread. Picked mine up in 2020 and the experience and quality was perfect."
Congrats Brittni!
"Look I get it, people like to overdo it but let’s not pretend that your anecdotal experience somehow has any more value than the other anecdotal experiences which tell horror stories. My delivery went wonderfully as well but I know it’s not the case for everyone."
Picked ours up last August. Congratulations.😃
"Got mine last week. I had some big issues, but it was poor communication from my local Tesla location. Basically, car was damaged in transit and I was either ghosted or given the runaround. Was supposed to get the car Feb 4th, then the following Saturday, then the following. When I finally got ahold of someone I basically said that I don’t want the original car/VIN if it suffered so much damage (was going to take a month to fix) and said new car or no car. Got on a priority list and picked it up on the 27th. Things would have been smoother if they communicated better. Probably an issue of short staffing, which they need to absolutely fix. Delivery day went without a flaw. In and out in less than 40 minutes (got there 20 minutes before my delivery time). No issues with car and have loved it this past week."
"Yeah, people love to hate on this car because its new, just like anything else. In reality, its a well run car company thats doing a lot of things differently, some better, some worse. If youre OK with different, you can have a great time owning a Tesla."
"OPs post Next week: How do I get my car to tell me distance from the wall while parking, i don’t see any settings Am I missing something?"
I picked mine up last month and also had a flawless experience.
Congratulations! Enjoy it!
Aye! MSM! love it. Welcome to the family and enjoy your ride
"Same here. Picked mine on March 03rd. Everything went great, the car was ready and didnt catch anything funny (I did watch videos on what to look for, etc). Now I ask myself what took me so long to make the switch, lol."
"For me I have issues with the quality. Trunk makes a weird noise when open and closing, I have a clear coat drip on the rear door panel, bumps on the paint at different areas and marks on my white door panel. Picked up my M3 on 3 weeks ago and the Tesla service Dept is backed up"
"Great car, great service, great buying experience."
I took delivery of 3 Teslas in a year. They are phenomenal experiences compared to crap dealerships. Who could possibly say this is worse.
Same!
Congrats! Miami Gardens pickup?
Welcome to the club! I have it’s older brother 2022. I still get in it every morning and smile.
Was hoping for a follow up curb rash. Congrats tho
Iv had 3 and loved them all. Minor inconveniences but they came to my house and fixed it for free so cannot complain! Please if you’re thinking about getting one.. DO IT
"Same here. I guess people just love to hate. Why? Fear because of ignorance? Envy? I dunno why. And I am someone that has spent four decades in the retail automotive business including almost 20 years of selling cars and later heavy trucks. Having been on the other side of the desk it was refreshing to complete the transaction including trade in less than 30 minutes on line. Also, when I went to pick it up an attractive and helpful young lady had me out of there in less than ten minutes. After almost two years of ownership Ive had the car in the service department only once after delivery for some minor adjustments. The car has been flawless since."
Hows the paintwork?
"As your twin in color and model, welcome! Took delivery of my M3 last weekend and had a very pleasant experience! Enjoy!"
Is your grandpa The Fonz?
Love every second I’m in mine.. I’m convinced that all the haters in here either 1) Don’t even own a Tesla. 2) Bought an abused used 2017 model 3 with 150k miles 3) Are rich as fuck and blow $100k on a car without even thinking about it. When you get your first Tesla you can’t help but treat it like a baby and do everything you can to make it last as long as possible lol.
Its totalled
"""Dont listen to the hate threads"" Why not? With respect, you having a flawless ordering experience doesnt change the experiences of others both during and after the ordering process. I also had a flawless ordering and collection experience with my Model 3... the problems started after collection. Most of the ""Hate threads"" are about problems experienced after ordering and collection - most companies are good until the point they get your money and worse after, but Teslas customer service can be truly terrible I mean, you just bought a $43k car with no parking sensors... just because youre basking in ""Just got my Tesla glow"" doesnt change the things Tesla are doing wrong"
"Shhhh don’t tell people that! They don’t like it when Tesla drivers have a good experience with the car. Congrats, enjoy it!!"
"Congrats! Wish I could say the same. I would still buy again, but unfortunately I was unlucky and did not get a flawless car at delivery, I think mine was painted in Fremont on a Friday after 5 when everyone started drinking"

"Nice work. Passenger headlight looks misaligned/popping out, but it could be the camera angle."
You must be an exception. Like winning the lottery
"Theres thank one thing in the one picture on one side of the car - but other than that, good looks ;)"
Yeah ok. Give it a a month or two and come talk to us about the rattles. Model 3 2022 owner.
 .
"Why is anyone accepting this? I would love to do an experiment with Tesla customers, how many components and features do you have to remove before they refuse delivery. Do you need four wheels, all the doors, headlights, all interior trim?"
"Its incredible that the lazy software design aspect is overflowing into the car business. ""We can patch it later"". Now its not even patches, its completely broken or missing features....in a 50 000$ car not in a 60$ game lol."
"I just want to point out something here, as myself and many of my technical colleagues on this sub have noted in the past... This, right here, is the fear that I have with Over-The-Air software update mechanisms (that are entirely unregulated globally) in safety-critical systems. Tesla made the choice to ship a ***system*** (hardware and software together) to a customer that was not fully validated for market-timing and/or cost reasons under the ***assumption*** that said ***system*** can be even ***initially*** validated later. Cars are not smartphones. The software is never independent from the hardware in a safety-critical system. They are a cohesive one. Foundational safety-critical systems fact here. This is a Tesla problem right now, but I can see this become an industry-wide problem. This is aside from the other thorny issues - like Configuration Management. ""Ship now, validate later"" can never be a safe strategy and regulators should be disallowing it."
This is a new low even by Teslas standards.
"to be fair, this frog has been boiling for a while, and if buyers are convinced that what they’re getting is incredibly desirable and scarce, they’ll overlook a lot. for example: our old mach-e order from 2022 was set to be delivered without park assist functionality and with a “prep kit”. there are other cars where features were not present at delivery and were supposed to be retrofitted later (when “later” was is never clear). this is simply the next logical step on that idiotic spectrum."
Seems like only yesterday Elmo was saying all cars shipped today WILL be fully capable of level 5 FSD. That was on version 1 of the hardware. Such incredible bullshit I dont even know where to begin. Lets start with the fact they werent even remotely close to achieving level 5 so there was no way to even know what sort of hardware was required.
I remember the stans mocking VW because the ID3 was being delayed due to software issues. Now they are gladly accepting cars without software and dont even know when they will get the software or if the software will even work. Someone really does need to be a special kind of stupid to give money to this guys.
This is why Elon says the best time to get a Tesla is always now. Because the longer you wait the worse itll get with less features.
Boeing did this with the 737 Max and 346 people died in two crashes.
> There are also no visualizations except for lane markings. Wow. So much for being ahead of the dinosaurs…
Im sure this was all thoroughly QAd and thought out before releasing and taking money.
"$85,000+ for a car with virtually no parking sensors...even the Chevy Bolt at $26k has that..."
Can’t wait for the Tesla FanBoys to justify the AP missing like the Park Assist. “I’ve driven for 20+ years without “AP” why would I need it.”
We went from the cars being able to drive themselves within a few weeks to… they have no autopilot at all… in 3 years.
"Sounds like they werent even informing buyers that their car came with HW 4.0 and that many software features were disabled. Owners are left with many what-ifs. Could be beneficial for the final FSD, but what if that requires a HW 5.0 which cant be retrofit? A long precedent for that with Tesla. What-if they dont get the software working in HW 4.0 for several years? What if HW 4.0 proves problematic since apparently untested? Teslas approach seems to be ""too bad for you"" to such inconsistencies."
"When is it not a work in progress? This was supposed to be fully functional level 4-5, several years ago. This honesty feels like the celebration of a milestone Tesla claimed to have passed in 2019."
"Lol. So for FSD to really work in the far future, you’d need a new car. What a scam."

"My Tesla came with a sticker listing all the features. I think most people are excited and do not look at this. When they delivered my car years ago, they wanted me to review and sign the paperwork standing up. Then, they were adding features rather than removing them. I got more than I ordered."
Sorry tesla fans but this is what happens wow. Your supposed CEO spends all day arguing with former twitter employees online
So they have lidar? HW 4 was supposed to have lidar right?
"I cant really complain about my MYLR. It was delivered in December 2021 (2022 Fremont build) and weve had zero issues with it. As a matter of fact, weve thought about another Tesla - maybe the new, smaller ""Model 2"" whenever it comes out - BUT considering all this crap with missing features, we have to think twice. Will this be a thing? Something that will be standard with Tesla?"
"Even the ""working"" assasinware , which I never bothered to check the displays on the youtube videos until recently is a complete joke. The graphics are worse than on a nintendo playing super mario bros. The thing displayed a train as a chain of trucks/semis, no joke, this is just crazy. The regulators are blind or being blindfolded by monetary interests."
Completely insane.
lol wut. cant believe they get away with this!
LMAO
Tesla is becoming more and more of a joke every day. No car made since June 2022 actually has all the advertised features. Too many elon clones put up with this garbage.
Already fixed

"The Mach-E did better than the Model Y (as the article correctly reports) in one test. What the article totally ignores is that the Model Y performed better overall Mach-E:  Model Y:  Both are still very safe cars though, differences are splitting hairs"
Not sure if I trust this since it is from Fox News
Ill take my chances in a Ford. Would prefer to NOT be trapped in a car that is on fire and melting the asphalt.
Obviously this is because Ford advertises with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety where Tesla does not. And it’s widely known that Ford also gives the crash test dummies free cars to evaluate further contributing to bias against Tesla.
🥈
"I always take any Tesla tests with a grain of salt. When you consider the fact that they ship cars to customers with ""placeholder"" parts and dummy cameras and essentially treat them like beta testers of hardware, I cant trust that the cars that the crash tests get are the same cars specs-wise that the customer gets."
"But, but, Musk said...."
Ford please please beat them in range too.
I’d take anything coming from Fox News with a grain of salt
Tesla has real life crash test with survivors
"This post is misleading and is fake news. When will Redit implement community notes? Simply put, modelY is a top safety pick plus, the mach-e is only a top safety pick. The difference has to do with the headlight deficiencies in the Mach-e. Both good ratings, the model Y is just slightly safer. Also, Tesla has unique features that may not be tested here that increase safety. Modifiable airbag deployment, depending on the weight and seating position of the front seat occupants. Seatbelt pretensioner deployment before an actual crash based on camera data, sensing an impending crash, eliminates the abrupt stop in forward motion in other cars."
Well that was certainly a video.
The engineers of Tesla did not think of that one. I can’t believe it ran upside down.
"Tesla engineers are seeing this in the data, really confused about this outlier. I want to know how efficient it was…"
"Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should."
Don’t hate me but I think it’s hilarious.
"WD has definitely found a way to appeal to a specific group of YT viewers, but man I don’t think he could be any more annoying."
That channel is super annoying. Ugh.
This is fun! Love it
Am I the only one who got angry for him abusing his Tesla like this?
"absolutely sickening that this is what passes for entertainment nowadays... wasting resources for 10 minutes of ""oh that was cool"""
I have seen some of his videos before. This guy is the biggest douche bag.
I absolutely love it
What an absolute bellend! I regret accidentally supporting his channel. Did he pay for repairs on the street he mauled driving with the clamp on his front tire?
Please for the love of god do not give another view to this
Yo fuck this loser
Im kind of surprised the suspension was able to not break off upside down
Men his age and younger are dying for democracy in Ukraine.
This guy is almost as annoying as Doug Demo... Nah I can’t even say that.

A Møøse once bit my sister...
[saved you a click someone give me gold](
"Pretty impressive. Some cars cant even do this unencumbered, and this passed with flying colors even at its max gross loaded weight. Much faster ECUs and electronic motor control showing itself maybe."
"Still disappointed, I didnt see a moose anywhere in that video."
"The video says the car is heavy, but its not. It weighs less than a C Class and the same as a 3 series."
[deleted]
I honestly thought the moose test was to see how safe a vehicle was if it hit a moose.. I’m Canadian 🤷🏻‍♂️
"It doesnt state specifically that the car is loaded to max, just inferred, as that the tires are at recommended pressure for such. There is a video out there of a Model 3 towing a 6,000 pound airstream. It doesnt do an actual moose test, but the driver puts it through a couple of good fast S curves, car doesnt have any problems at all with the maneuver."
"Reading those weights it doesnt surprise me, because the weights do. Im 80kg. The 3 passengers I travelled 1500 miles with to go skiing in our Model 3 add another 200kg. Fully loading the frunk and trunk with everything we were taking was probably another 80kg. So thats 360kg extra on top of the kerb weight. Yet the max weight quoted is only 309kg over the kerb weight. Realistically Id be saying that Tesla would be looking at: 400kg for driver and 4 passengers, and 150-200kg for luggage and bikes on a bike rack as a realistic maximum load. Its very easy to imagine that an overweight family of just 3 people would exceed that 309kg"
Quite a big difference between ICE og EV in terms of center of gravity
[actual IIHS press release since FXN only links their own articles 🙄](
"Article fails to mention that the Model Y beats the Mach-E in two areas on the updated side-impact test, so which one is actually ahead? Probably the one that is a 2023 Top Safety Pick+, the Model Y.  "
But what about the Cash Test?
Good now be cheaper
Why are we reading Fox News as any credible source??? Reddit should blanket ban.
Cherry-picked click bait article for sure.
I wonder if they improved on their embarrassing moose test fail? 
"I wonder if Fords Mach-E beats Teslas Model Y in the **Drive off a 250 foot cliff and see who survives** test? Or, is that too real world? \-  \- ["
And you wonder why people dont trust the news anymore.
"Oh, a Fox News article, we will now find the text messages that say that this is all fake information, and they ran it anyway."
Good job Ford. Safe vehicles are good vehicles.
lmao sure
How does a family of four do when driven off a 250-foot cliff onto rocks below? Cause we know for a fact theyll live if theyre in a Y.
Fox lies.
When is the mustang electric convertible coming 😭

Tesla cult is on cue as usual.
And now comments are getting removed for calling Tesla out.... how.... uncult like lol
Lol at this thread with people that have 100% of their 401k in the stock

[This is how a moose test can look when it *isnt* good]( for those wanting a point of reference.
There really shouldnt be any BEV failing the moose test due to the batteries in the floor.
i love the ionic at the end that absolutely aced it with no further commentation.
""
"This is for SR+, does the LR do worse, due to higher weight? (He says the SR+ does well, for a car of its weight)"
and here I am thinking Im gonna see a video of a Tesla ramming a moose.
I am pretty sure the cars are handling it better than the vast majority of drivers would. Some might make the first turn but completely blow the next or not even try. it is an odd test to be sure... [because we know in the 1970s in Sweden twenty percent]( of all accidents involved the Moose
I was waiting for an animatronic moose
Fun side note: the moose test is part of the winter driving test that you have to do to get Swedish driver’s license.
I have both the Tesla Model 3 SR and the Jeep Grand Cherokee. The best and worst performing moose tests.
Wow. Never heard of this test but now its eye-opening.
Most EVs are really good at this test. This is one of the many reasons that EVs just make more sense than ICE cars
I love how Europeans [dont mince words]( The whole video is barely over 1 minute long 👍🏻
Shouldt they use a stationary fire truck to really test safety? Preferably at 80mph.
Not really an eye opener. Low slung sedans of any flavor usually easily pass the Moose Test. The challenge is for SUVs due to their much higher CoG.
Show the mustang one to anyone thinking Mustang has better handling than the Model Y.
*cries in December delivery Model 3*
"Applicants are not eligible for CVRP rebates if their gross annual incomes are above the following thresholds: $135,000 for single filers, $175,000 for head-of-household filers, or $200,000 for joint filers. The income cap applies for all eligible vehicle types except fuel-cell electric vehicles."
"Woohoo! Just ordered Model Y. Now, I need to sell the Model 3."
Just got my application approved! Ordered a 2023 M3 RWD February 4th from existing inventory. Picked up delivery on February 11th. Applied in February 12th with temporary registration and documents provided in the documents section of the Tesla app/website. Heard back today that I was approved and should receive an email when my check is sent out.
"Delivery dates keep slipping though. Used to be ""January"". Then it changed to February. Checked this morning and its ""April 5 - May 10""."
*price increases $2k tomorrow*
"Have you looked at the income requirements? Interestingly as the dollar is inflated, the income requirements (ie 200k max agi for joint filers) have gone way down. This is going to exclude a lot of people"
Wish my state provided any incentive lol
I got my model 3 delivery on February 5th. My total price was $45490. Base price was $43490 and I chose red color so paid extra 2k. Am I still eligible for rebate I read on CVRP website that base price should be below 45k.
"oh, that pesky income gap. :("
Awesome. Good thing I’m (somewhat) poor!
"This is in addition to whatever the feds may give us? Wow. Im waiting on my MYLR currently projected for March-May delivery, so fed guidance will likely be out by then."
"Does anyone know why BEVs are only getting $2000, but the Hydrogen ones are getting $4500?"
"Am I reading this right? If you got it before March 15 2022, you can still apply for a rebate?"
"AFTER FEB. 28: Does anyone know if CVRP rebate for California change on Feb 28 willincrease for standard applicant (not talking about people making under400%FPL).I know website said will increase for those 400%FPL but wonders if basic standard applicant will see any increase or still just $2000. UPDATE: just spoke to rep at CVRP regarding after FEB 28 >> for standard applicant no new increase, so it will still be the same $2000 rebate (unless you are below 400%FPL then you can get 7.5k)."
The income caps are pretty dumb IMO- why not incentivize everyone to drive a cleaner vehicle? I can promise that credit is important to those who make more than some arbitrary number ($130k for single filers)
CA with the money printer!
Is there a msrp cap? I didnt see it in the article.
"If I bought a model 3 in 2018 and applied for this back then, can I do it again ? My new model Y is under both mine and the wife, so I wonder if I should submit it for her name. Also is income cap for 2021 tax returns or 2022?"
Want to get one but was holding off because of the ultrasonic sensors. Genuine questions to those that have 3/Ys without them - how is it working with vision? I just cant imagine that ever being as good as real sensors? Does it bug you?
Isnt the rebate amount going to increase on February 28th?
So much total rebate now with the federal rebate? 9k?
So 2000 in addition to the 7500 rebate that already exists?
This doesn’t count for used purchases right?
"I bought a model 3 with 11k on the clock in oktober 2022 for 45.500 euro, sold it last week with 28k on the clock for 35.000 euros. Thanks Elon! At this point diesel is cheaper than electric and no charging time. So goodbye electric, hopefully for ever"
This applies to lease as well right?
Oh man so tempted to get a m3 right now
Quick question.. which document would we provide for proof of registration if were still working with our temporary license plate #? First time doing this just wanted to make sure I upload the correct document
Does this apply to used models?
"Question. This isn’t about a Tesla, my car is eligible but I just found out about this. I’m about 4 months out from purchase. Anyway I can still get this rebate?"
I ordered my m3 in early Jan rip
"Does anyone know how the household information works on CVRP? Im a single filer and live with 2 roommates but idk their income since we dont really talk. Should I put 0 on the ""Not including yourself how many members of your household are 18 years of age and older?"" because its asking total household income and it also says I need to put them on there so Im confused whether it makes to just include myself, my income and have that as the total household income?"
I was excited… until I came in $22.00 over the income limit…
"Question: Californian resident here. Already submitted my 2022 taxes and refund received, and my AGI was <$20,000 married filing jointly. 2023 my AGI should be \~ <$200,000 married filing jointly. Do I qualify for the $7500 and $2000 CVR rebate?"
"Just to double confirm. The timeline/application for rebates (assuming you qualify) if you buy a Tesla in 2023 (before March 31,2023) Federal Rebate $7500 - You claim the tax credit on Form 8936 for 2023 tax return (file in 2024) California CVRP Rehab $2000-$7500 - File on website within 90 days of purchase."

"Worked as a quality engineer in the car industry for several years and came in contact with many car brands including Porsche, Mercedes Benz, Volkswagen, BMW, Tesla, Hyundai, etc. Teslas quality is one of the poorest Ive ever came across. Especially when you consider the price point of those cars. A little side note. You can actually find traces of bromine in the synthetic leather used in the Tesla Model 3. I will never ever buy a Tesla for the price they are offering it."
The build quality is a pretty common complaint on Teslas. * 
"[Man Unknowingly Unlocks And Drives Off In Someone Elses Tesla]( And recently, this happened too. I can bet you, every Tesla owner is trying to unlock every other Tesla, to see if this is true. Just imagine walking away from your car knowing that this is possible :-/"
People that tell you a Tesla is actually high quality have never actually been in a high quality car.
My mom got one and recently the handles have been sticky and dont pop back. She called the local tesla store and its a $1200 repair!!
The funny thing is the Tesla made in china is better build quality
"The way you keep calling it a golf cart and came up with the price $19,150 gets me 🤣"
"As someone who owns a Model 3, I can say that while it has its flaws, its still a great car. Its not for everyone, but plenty of people appreciate its unique features and benefits."
Tesla are bad in general
Overpriced according to who? Because there would seem to be a sustained demand for these cars that outpace the actual number of units being manufactured. Why would Tesla reduce the price below what people are willing to pay?
This is slowly becoming less and less unpopular thankfully. Tesla’s are overpriced shit.
"I mean, that’s what you get with a pos electric car. Hopefully next loaner you get has an internal combustion engine."
No shit
Thats just all teslas ngl
It drives itself on the highway...
"You are paying for the prestige, which is the whole point of expansive cars to begin with, otherwise everyone would be buying a Toyota Prius"
Im not sure this is an unpopular opinion. I know people like the electric car concept but the fit and finish of a Tesla sucks. Theres tons of videos all over the internet of people just picking apart how cheap and poorly assembled they are.
Its a below median priced car and has all the shortcomings of such a car at that price. Its the Model S that is way overpriced.
"I drove one once, and I dont know if that description is particularly accurate from what I experienced because I didnt notice any of that stuff, but I admit it was only for an hour or so."
"Never tried the Model 3. The newer Model S is built pretty well, fortunately. Absolutely zero hardware issues after about a year."
I’ve never driven one but they look hideous in white and that seems to be the most popular colour
You can get a Nissan Leaf for 5K less if you’d like. Tell me that doesn’t feel like a golf cart…
"I went from a 2017 BMW 330xi to a new 2023 Tesla 3 Performance. I can say the BMW was higher quality fit and finish. But the newer teslas are much better in this category than previous years. Going from 0-60 in 3 seconds, cornering like its on rails, and the wonderful premium sound system in the tesla for a price of $45k (with federal tax credit) vs similar specs from the $112k BMW M5 competition? Its a no-brainer. Ill happily trade less fit and finish... and get 125 miles per gallon equivalent with Chicagolands low-priced electricity rates."

Im starting to see a trend between humans and car crashes
Wrong pedal. Common regardless of brand.
The lawyers really lost a big meal ticket on this
"I’m sure this will be widely reported and all of the outlets that jumped to saying it was on Autopilot at the time will recant their stories to maintain their standards of journalism. Just kidding. Report some unconfirmed nonsense for the clicks and when facts to the contrary come out, hide."
I wonder if the rest of the deadly car crashes that day get the same attention ?
And the trailer didn’t even have a proper Mansfield bar.
Sadly the only reason it didnt shear the whole roof is the car reached the tandems. Reasons why I run with my wheels back as far as the state Im in allows if the trailer can stay at axle weight. The impact bars on most trailers do nothing. I read somewhere this was intentional though? Is that what theyre calling human error now?
"Well, duh. Even in autopilot, the brakes still work."
"Only news because it’s a Tesla. Cars on cruise control exempt, why?"
That’s a design flaw. Tesla should remove the accelerator pedal in all cars immediately!
Spoiler alert: They’re all human error.
Has anyone seen an update/debunking of that viral clip of the Tesla in China speeding thru a town and crashing after trying to park? The one with all of the CCTV clips.
This proves again that trailers need to be built safer. Like in most of Europe.
"Is there a website of someone keeping track of all these crashes, with updates after the investigations complete?"
Poor Dinesh. He went full insane mode.
"Why does every Tesla crash make headlines? There are almost 40,000 fatal car accidents in the USA PER YEAR!"
[deleted]
Thousands of human error crashes every year. Yet people are so desperate for full self driving to kill someone so they can say how dangerous they are.
2015 is also pre-FSD so they shouldn’t bring that up.
Probably on the phone
Decapitated…while big thing. We had a funeral for a bird
Obviously.
"Honestly, the only weird thing about this is that they went into the semi truck parking area of the rest area, and not the car parking area. The likelihood of Autopilot, or FSD Beta, being engaged was *super* low, because this is a rest stop. FSD Beta causing the accident wouldve had to have meant that they manually added the rest area to the navigation, which is a pain in the ass to do, and serves no real benefit. Yes, they couldve engaged the system as they were getting off the road, but thats highly unlikely."
"Save money, live better."
[removed]
"Human error or not, when will the system start to prevent this regardless if you have AP/FSD engaged or not. The car should always be trying its best to avoid a collision regardless of which pedal you press."
Teslas are cheap and ugly not even a brand name car yet why because they dont even run right have too many problems plus damn ugly
One of the reason why I drive suv
2015 would be an AP1 car anyway.
"So, I just want t o know should a person be blamed for every accident that occurs in an autonomous driving situation? And is there a need for autonomous driving to continue to exist?"
"Story breaks: 30,000 upvotes for dangerous auto driving Tesla. Elon bad, FSD Bad. Investigation results break: 10 upvotes, dies in new."
"> As recently shared by industry watchers in China, the analysis of data from the ill-fated Model Y had been completed. As per the investigation, the vehicle’s accelerator was pressed 100% the entire time. The Model Y’s brakes were off as well. >“Five secs prior crash, speed 164km/h, steering wheel angle moved 25°, stability control on, speed down to 159km/h, back up to 163km/h & crash,” an industry watcher from China, shared on Twitter."
Sounds like suicide by a Tesla. Like the Doctor that drove off the cliff with is family but survived.
"Holy shit. I knew Tesla had a lot of data from the car, but I had no idea they knew details as minute as the steering angle!"
Why do these investigations take so much time if the conclusion is derived from the data. Would it not be possible to clear up such incidents by making the data publicly available?
"“ Tesla stated that the Park button was indeed pressed during the vehicle’s final drive four times, but only briefly.” So how long do you need to hold the button to force a shutdown? Is that documented so users know before driving the car?"
"Note to new Tesla drivers.... if youre panicking.. and you want the car to slow down, take your foot away from the pedals."
Y’all remember when Toyotas were “accelerating out of control” back in like the early 2000s? Same thing… sometimes ape brain ceases function and the nut behind the wheel keeps mashing the throttle thinking it is the brake.
You dont say!
"It looks like OP posted an AMP link. These should load faster, but AMP is controversial because of [concerns over privacy and the Open Web]( Maybe check out **the canonical page** instead: **[ ***** ^(Im a bot | )[^(Why & About)]( | )[^(Summon: u/AmputatorBot)]("
"Ive seen enough human stupidity in my life that whenever I see any sort of news story about someone getting hurt/killed involving any sort of equipment/machinery/vehicle, the first thing I question is the end user. I try my best not to get dragged along by outrage culture."
So either the driver was pressing the accelerator (maybe accidentally thinking it was the brake) OR isn’t it possible the sensor that interprets the pedal position went awry and was commanding 100% when there was no physical input? In the computer logs that would look like the driver was inputting full throttle.
"But shouldnt, ideally, the car stop itself crashing even IF the driver is trying to force it? Weve tried (very slowly, obviously) to drive my parents 2019 volvo at a (soft) obstacle, and it straight up wont do it, emergency brakes apply well in advance. Given Teslas hardware is obviously far more advance, surely they have a similar feature, no?"
Lesson: dont use cheap floor mats. /speculation
TSLA is drive by wire... so like...
Probably one of those people who drives with both feet got the pedals confused
MSM PERFOEMANCE GANG :D congrats! Having a blast with mine a year in. Youll never be bored with it. May you put many terrified smiles on peoples faces with it 😉😉 shes got some punch
I have this exact model / color on order - it looks fantastic in your photos - enjoy!
oh my lord....one more month one more month...
"Here is my review of the 2023 Tesla Model 3 Performance! As a Tesla and EV enthusiast, I have been eagerly waiting to get my hands on this electric beast, and Im thrilled to share my thoughts with you. Firstly, lets talk about the pros of this car. The panel gaps are excellent, and the paint job is flawless, making the car look incredibly sleek and modern. The car arrived clean and well-maintained upon delivery, which is always a good sign. The speed and handling of the car are out of this world, and the upgraded suspension compared to the Model Y Long Range is noticeable, making for a smoother and more comfortable ride. The audio system is top-notch, and there are no rattling noises while driving, which indicates that the car is tightly constructed and built to last. I opted for the Metallic Silver Metal color and black interior, and I have to say, it looks stunning. The silver gives the car a modern and sophisticated look, while the black interior adds to the cars sporty and sleek appearance. Ive owned a Model Y with white seats before, but the black seats in the Model 3 feel more plush and comfortable, which is a significant improvement. The wood trim took some time to get used to, but now I see the Model 3 as the ""executive"" car, as it feels so premium and well-designed. Not sure what they did to the cameras, but they are much higher quality than my 2022 Model Y Long Range. Could be the snappier AMD chip but they look great on screen. HW4? 🥹👉🏻👈🏻 As for the cons, there are only a few minor issues that I have encountered. The glovebox is a bit finicky, and the headlights dont fit perfectly, but these are easy fixes that can be taken care of with an at-home service appointment. Additionally, the car is low to the ground, which might take some getting used to if youre used to driving larger vehicles, but its not a significant issue. Overall, Im impressed with the 2023 Tesla Model 3 Performance. The cars impressive speed, handling, and audio system, combined with its sleek appearance, make it a top contender in the electric car market. Despite a few minor issues, the car is well-built and well-designed, making it a great investment for any car enthusiast looking for a high-quality electric car. If youre considering buying a Model 3, I highly recommend taking a closer look at these options to elevate your driving experience even further."
Your paintwork looks extra shiny. Ceramic Coated?
Sharp
I got the exact same color scheme and model last month. Only 5 weeks old with 700 miles but I’m liking the car enough to say I wish it lasts me 8 years
"I really want to commit to ordering this same spec. Love the white but have already owned 1 black, 1 blue, and 2 white vehicles. Im over the few initial hesitancies I had towards going EV after learning more about them. Now Im hung up on waiting out for HW4 and the *very much rumored* model 3 refresh. I know at some point even those will become the *older* models, but I always go for the next best thing. Maybe I shouldnt worry about that and just do it lol"
Gorgeous car!
"Nice, Ive read that some of the newer models have a larger battery pack and come with the 20 inch standard rims, head to head the model right before those improvements (I think 2019) is a bit lighter/quicker. Referring only to the M3P, what I read I believe compared the 2023 to the 2019(stealth) models Mind you difference is negligible as its about 0.1s difference if that data is to be believed."
I have a wrapped 3M satin black and this is the only paint color I’m jealous of 😭
"hey we are brothers, same color and performance edition! I went to order 2 weeks ago and they had one in stock in Dallas (I live in Austin) so I committed on 3/3. Sold my 2020 hybrid accord on 3/10 and picked up on 3/11 then had a blast driving back to austin. i actually didnt plan on getting the white interior (I swear they hid that on the in stock part) but its growing on me for sure. My heart sunk on pick up, but it looks super classy and nice so I am going to stick with it, I love the car too much! I found the ""leather"" to be pretty nice and soft, exactly what i would expect. I am doing full PPF front end and back bumper, I am also adding rockers. I havent decided just yet on tint but leaning towards 15% on all doors and back window, and then since I am in Texas I will be doing the front windshield with the respective tint there too. Ceramic coating interior and exterior on just about everything possible, ill make sure to send pics!"
Ordered a deep blue M3P 2 days ago. Immediately changed my build to MSM after seeing your post. Love the color and how well it goes with the black trim and wheels.
I bought my M3P in September of 2021. She sure is fun. #teamred
"I have the same build, took delivery 2 weeks ago and just for 30% ceramic tint"
"Forgot to ask in my previous comment. When did you order and when did you take delivery (and if you don’t mind, what state / part of the country are you in.)"

">Tesla moderators removed my post from their page for violating rules. I dont know what was violation. Youre not allowed to criticize El Maestro, you should know that, silly!"
The violation is you failed to add “still love my car” when posting something potentially negative.
"Muked hard and dry, Elon is a conman."
>Tesla moderators removed my post from their page for violating rules. I dont know what was violation. You gave a negative review of Tesla. Thats it. Theyre a cult. Tesla can do nothing wrong.
The deposit is now non refundable? Thats bullshit. What if you got all the way to delivery and found one tiny flaw and refused to accept it?
"This is not to defend what happened, however, I do know Tesla doesn’t buy your car. They have a network of dealers who buy the used cars on behalf of Tesla. So, it probably looked up the KBB value of your car to give an estimate and then sent the details to their network of dealers who bid on it. Your Value is probably because there wasn’t strong demand for your car and a dealer bid very low and won. You can always take it to CarMax and sell it to them."
"Which subreddit? I was perma-banned from teslamotors for simply linking a tweet by Elon. I was perma-banned from TeslaLounge after my first post. I never post anything untrue. Try Model 3 forum since they allow candid discussion. The others have ultrafan mods who tolerate nothing even remotely critical of Tesla or Elon. I hate dealerships, but I would never put a deposit down on any car. Not handing over a dime until I can fully inspect the car, so not a candidate for buying a car via the web."
Lesson #1 - Tesla is full of shit.
Chargeback
This cannot be true!!!!! Color me shocked!!!!!
Everything about this company is a scam designed to funnel money into Musk’s hands.
>Tesla moderators removed my post from their page for violating rules. Because this post doesnt pump the stock!
"If this isnt a red flag for you, i dont know what is"
Same happened to me. Got an estimate of $21K.. placed a deposit on new Model Y. Less than a week later time to pick up Model Y and suddenly my final estimate for my trade in has dropped to $19K. Couldn’t speak with anyone over the phone except my SA who said “he had nothing to do that department”. Got so angry was ready to walk away completely. Ended up refusing the trade. Taking delivery of the Y.. and keeping my old car. Immediately listed it on Facebook marketplace where a local Honda dealer bought it for $23K.. or about $4K higher than Teslas highest offer! You always hear the Cult talk about they love buying a new Tesla because dealerships play too many games. And while that is true.. Teslas plays even worst games. There is simply no excuse for giving a trade estimate.. when the final offer can change by several thousands of dollars even a day later. Carmax and others have given trade in quotes in writing.. that are good for 7 days. As you can imagine I would never trade in another vehicle to Tesla. They are shady as fuck.
"Look at it this way, you have only cheated yourself of 250 and you have not fallen into buying that pile of crap that is the Model Y. Get over it and dont buy anything that comes from Tesla etc. They are shit cars, with shit customer service. With one of the most toxic communities of fanboys. (You already knew this shortly after you investigated, so you already knew where you were getting into, It cant surprise you)."
So sell it to carmax.
Sell your used car private party. Trade-ins are generally a rip -off
"You could maybe sue Tesla and hope you get your $250 back plus costs and damages. In my opinion youre better off just forgetting Tesla, and getting a Hyundai IONIQ 5 or a Kia EV 6 or a VW ID4 or a Ford Mustand Mach-E or an Audi e-tron. In my opinion, with any of those, youll be getting a better car. Some people would debate that. But no reasonable person can deny that youd be dealing with a better company if you got something other than Tesla. And that $250 is just the beginning. Just wait until that Model Y needs a repair -- which might not be a long wait, given Teslas quality-control problems. When a Tesla needs to be repaired, thats when they REALLY begin to fuck you over."
"I was very interested in buying a model Y because of the tax rebate. I wanted to see the fees and taxes on the car before deciding on which car to buy. I went to the website and spec the car I wanted and before showing me anything about final fees and taxes, they stopped me at the $250 deposit. I wonder how many people have forfeited this $250 🤔. I went with a different car. For the price of the Y there is so many other cars and the interior is inferior to everything else."
"Same happened to me, just not quite as extreme. First offer was $3k under the estimate, so I rejected it and resubmitted. Second offer came in $500 higher, so I accepted then later rejected as the delivery date approached. Third offer came in $1500 higher so I called it good enough."
Just sell your old car yourself. It’s not that difficult. I financed 100% on my model 3 and sold my car privately. I’ll use the old car money to pay down the principal on the Tesla.
Tesla doesnt do anything with the trade unless its another Tesla. Their offer is an estimate of what the car will bring at an auto auction. Unless you just dont care all the data indicates its better to sell your car elsewhere than to accept the Tesla trade in offer.
"I dont see the problem, apart from you not having read / understood the process. Once you have done a predeposit, you can ask for a trade-in. Not vice-versa. Ordering a car at 250 $ predeposit is one thing. Asking a trade-in offer is another process. You are free to cancel the Tesla trade-in offer. As you are free cancel your Tesla order. Try this with any other ""fraud dealer""."
"My trade in value was smack dead in the middle of their estimate. And I ran the trade in within the 7 day estimate window that I got. Estimate says good for 7 days while the final says good for 30. I know one of my buddies did it and his offer was lower than estimate bc he had an accident on the history and I’ve also heard the estimate doesn’t run your vin, while the offer does. This can bring up accident history, see if the car was a rental etc. basically run a carfax. Give them a call or stop by a local store and they can tell you why."
But StEaLeRsHiPs
It probably couldve hit 208 if theyd just removed the brakes all together :)
Time to bring it back to nurturing. Last time they maxed out the limiter due to this. Edit: Nurburing autocorrects to nurturing.
"According to GPS, 350 kph according to speedo."
A link directly to the youtube video so others can avoid that site 
Did the brakes make it go faster?
The fact that this guy did it with the yoke is amazing
[deleted]
Why is this available to consumers? No one should ever go near that speed. Ever.
What a vague article. I cant think of anyone Id less like to see trying to go 200mph for the youtubes than a typical and untrained tesla driver.

It’s really hard to pass on for the new price point compared to other EVs.
"Tesla had two new factories ramping up in 2022, both of them just making the Model Y. Their production at the end of 2022 was way higher than at the beginning. Over the year on average Toyota was selling about 95k Corollas a month, but they had a few really good sales months this spring, and then volume was down the rest of the year (at least based on US sales which are roughly 20-25% of all sales). At the beginning of the year Teslas Model Y production from Freemont and Shanghai was probably averaging at least 55k per month, but by the end of the year both Austin and Berlin were probably doing around 3k/week or 12kish a month. So maybe a 80k/month rate at the end of the year. Its pretty likely that on a monthly basis the Model Y started off outside the top 10 best selling cars, but by the end of the year it was either 1 or 2 in the world, and averaged out to #4 for the whole year. And just because models from every manufacturer arent evenly distrusted everywhere, the Model Y ended up being the best selling car overall in some markets. But both Berlin and Austin are still ramping up, theyre both targeted to increase production by another 100k a year or so. Global production will likely be well over 1 million this year, and could easily be the best selling car of the year. In fact, when volumes start to get up towards the 1.2 to 1.3 million ranger were talking about one of the best selling modern cars of all time. Whats really amazing is that at the start of 2019 the Model Y wasnt even in production yet. In less than 5 years it could go from zero sales per year to the best selling car of the year, potentially one of the best selling cars ever made."

"Went from the 3 to the Y and the Y is so much better. Drives like a 3, but bigger, good build quality, lots of space. Dont think there is a better car out there. The performance version makes me laugh every time I gun it. Im in love with this car."
"""there is no demand."" ""there is a demand problem"""
"Great vehicle! Glad to see it competing against cars generally. All the ev specific rankings seem silly, like of course Tesla is #1 ev. It’s in total auto market that matters"
I also ordered 1. I was in the market for an EV. (My first) I never considered Tesla because it was way out of my price range. After shopping around and every dealer around me had huge markups I started to wait. Then the price cut and tax incentives made it too good to pass up. I just hope I get mine in time for the cut. (2/20-3/27)
"I cant think of a car that is better for most use cases. Still expensive for many, but other than that there is nothing better really."
"Model Y is obviously poised to take the top spot this year. If the 3 were to receive a little love, it could take the third spot this year. But I doubt it’ll get that."
"It would be useful to have an article with the list which isnt a site with Tesla in the name, behind a pay wall, or a tweet to show the skeptics who will otherwise claim manipulated figures."
Absolutely doomed. Shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.
Looking at the rate of change on the chart youd think it will be certain to be number 1 in 2023.
What? Is this really true?
"Ford: ""Teslas cutting prices and kicking our asses, what should we do?"" Fords dealership network: ""Jack up all our prices and stop taking orders on our most popular new models!"" Ford: ""Done!"""
I find it surprising that amount of people can afford a 45k-50k dollar car. Its like a $600-$700 monthly payment plus insurance.
I have a MY from 15 month… so happy!!! Each day i thank tesla for a so beautiful car!!!
"I mean if there ever was an example of supply and demand its this. Tesla lowered prices and can actually deliver the model y within a couple months. Not to mention the intense surge to try to save the additional money through the tax credit. If our government actually prioritized electrification for climate change, they wouldnt put so many restrictions on obtaining the tax credit, including the income limits. Imagine what the demand would be if that occurred.."
Do u guys think there will be more of a price drop?
whY?
Surprised that many folks can afford a luxury car heading into a recession lol
Announcing price drop and not providing incentive to those who just purchased and not being able to get access to green véhicule rebate because of that is not right! Not only you miss $13000 rebate but also up to $7000 on government incentive. I’m looking for information on how to initiate a class action. Any guidance ? Thx in advance
That sucks as they are such pieces of shit lol 
Model Y is the only one selling and the other models aren’t. Tesla is a one model car company.
"Im kinda excited for the world to move to electric cars, as long as there are more gas stations, I hope this inspires people to buy electric cars (Tesla) in 2023 🤞"
Add me to the family; I just ordered a blue model Y. I hope to get it in March.
Yall people change vehicles so often... Damn....
Nice congrats. Sorry that someone already vandalized it with a Sharpie. Those damn never EVers.
"After auto-crossing this at the BMW events, I put myself in line for an allocation. It was good value against the Tesla Model 3 Performance in the mid to low 60s (with tax credit). Now it seems like the BMW is in the 70s and the tesla model 3 performance in the high 40s after the new tax credit. I have since ordered the TM3P. I get how this is more luxurious in many ways, but 30 grand is a whole chunk of change that I have better uses for. I honestly loved the power, but the handling was a mixed bag. Im also fine to hang out and see what the next iteration of these cars look like."
"Have had this car for a three weeks now. Replaced my Model 3 after it’s lease ended. The M50 has a one year wait, but I acquired it from a dealer after waiting for 3 months. Put my name down with a 5-6 dealers and eventually found one that was a cancelled order but had all the options I wanted (minus laser lights). Absolutely in love with this car. Essentially have stopped driving my XC 90 SUV now, even when kids are around. 6-7 years back I had an e92 335i. This car very much feels like a refined version of that. 335i had HEAVY steering and honestly the best car I had driven. The m50 gets the steering just right, and hugs the road. I don’t think it’s worth comparing to the Tesla. It feels like that this car is in a different class category. Obviously way better fit and finish, luxury, materials, paints, build quality, options etc. I am getting about 3 mi/kWh, that should translate to about 240-250 miles of range. Happy to answer more questions"
Car and Driver really likes it. Im interested to see what the next generation looks like.
"I’m sure it’s an amazing car, but it blows my mind that it has such a massive front end and yet no frunk."
Decided to check when my order was placed. Jan 13 last year… Think I’m just going to get my deposit back. Since I’m replacing a Model Y I need more of a kid hauler anyway.
How do you find the “autopilot” in BMW compared to Tesla’s?
"These are really nice, just wish there was more rear seat room, if it did we would seriously consider replacing our Model 3 with one. Alas, the i4 doesn’t have enough rear room for our use case and the iX is too expensive, to this day I still wish BMW brought the iX3 here."
"Nice! Im excited to replace my Model S with something from an established player soon (looking at the Lyriq, but really liked what I saw from BMW)"
Nice. Carplay!
"I daily a P3 and the M50 left me unimpressed after test driving it. I feel too many concessions were made since this is not a ground up electric. Cabin felt super cramped. BMW has been my go to (Ive owned 7), but I couldnt trade the P3 for this."
"What do you think? I’m a current x5 and model 3 owner and I can’t shake the feeling that the 3 ain’t my car! Thinking of trading in the 3 for i4M50, so would love your opinion."
"Congrats! Got the same color. I’m averaging 320 miles of range right now. Almost at 8000 miles and haven’t had any issues with the car. Simply love it and hope you do, too."
You did all that scribbling and I can still read the license plate. Good job. Next time try steady solid stripes
I have the edrive40 and I love it. Glad you are happy!
After owning a Tesla then getting a real luxury car is like a night and day difference… can’t wait to replace my 3 with a Porsche.
Congrats. Looks great
I just cant get past the current Beaverian Motor Works design theyve adopted.
"Really nice car but personally, the console looks way too chaotic to me after getting used to the minimal Model 3. Its probably a lot more functional, but I just enjoy minimalistic, clutter-free design."
Nice!
Love it! How are you enjoying it so far? Hows the range and ride/build quality? This was definitely on my list of possible future EVs.
"How’s it been adjusting to the much worse infotainment(lack of charging stops when navigating), lack of frunk, and lack of a robust, reliable and consistent charging network?"
"How well does charging work on short cross-country drives (say 250miles)? With the Tesla, I could always find a supercharger, or somehow charge slowly at a garage. However, on these trips, charging halfway was often mandatory."
"A little more luxury, a little slower and a little more expensive to run than the Model 3 P. Fair tradeoffs. "
Nice! What’s the range?
Congrats!
Isnt the i4 the one that [just got recalled](
"Honestly, why does everyone have to say “former Tesla owner”? Especially in a post like this that says “I’m not gonna compare…” And then compares. Lol. Why not just say “here’s my sick new car. Let me know if you have any questions!”"
Beware the angry beaver! Its growing on me.
Looks great from almost every angle!
"Thanks for your insight OP. I read most of your comments and have learned some cool stuff. It’s a beauty, enjoy!"
How can people afford driving two teslas and now this. I have never driven a Tesla in my life
"Hmm, I really don’t like the interior, it feels a bit dated. But no offense, you liking it is all that matters :-)"
Now you have a proper car with a proper interior I laugh when told the S or 3 is a luxury ev.
Going from Tesla to this is like going from Lada to Rolls Royce. Enjoy.
Has it gone to the shop yet? BMW can be concerning for maintenance
Ugly ass grill but nice car
Wow alot of folks here who have been hood winked by Elmo. You guys need to check out the competition. They are on a different level then tesla trash...
Why? Wait until you travel and need charging.
BMW=Back at Motor Workshop
"So much front end to that thing, stylish but seems like a waste of space. How does usable cargo and passenger space compare between it and the M3?"
How the heck u downgraded from model s to model 3? Ans now picked I4 which is basically series 4 with battery?
Probably personal preference but Tesla makes interior of Beamer look like a 2 year old designed it
Can you detail its self driving capabilities please?
These things are growing on me in a way I never thought they would. Looks killer in that color!
interior is a downgrade. yikes. maybe some like the styling??
bmw use brushed motor. good luck :D
"Looks sharp. That license plate doesnt look street legal, though."
I’m sorry to hear this
It’s a paper plate.
It’s nice. I wanna trade in my m3 lr with this. Dealers going crazy with 10k markup
What are your biggest take aways having driven both cars?
Nice upgrade!
Congratulations?
I am proud of you. Ive seen a few videos and I am really impressed. Congrats.
You gotta pay 2k a month for the full performance of the car? Just wait till BMW DRM’s your ability to drive the thing lol.
I love mu i4 it’s so much nicer to drive than my previous model 3
Whats your job & side hussles? Where do I sign up for dropshipping classes?
Post purchase servicing or maintenance? Are there any? Their ICE cars are heavy on your pockets once warranty runs out. How will BMW and Mercedes survive since a chunk of their business was car service? Can you give a comparison with Tesla?
The BMW Nostrils
"Hey, congrats on finding a vehicle you enjoy! Im on my second tesla and in between i test drove as many others as I could. I think the best alternative was a polestar2, I could really feel a build quality difference between my 19 model 3 and the polestar. Others? Not so much (not going to include a rented taycan in this discussion because its porsche obviously). I wasnt able to try out any i4s because my local dealership didnt have any. I think in general I found that some build quality was better, other technical things were worse. Having also rented a tesla as part of a vacation of a newer model year....I think build quality is going up over time but for what ends up being an expensive sedan or crossover in the model 3/y, build quality should be pegged closer to a bmw 3/x3."
How is the interior space compared to model s?
Why?
How the M50’s driver assist system comparing to Tesla’s AP? I use AP 80% of the daily commute.
And BMW looks 200×times better...
Enjoy the bad range
"Put your story on the Waynetrain and ride it to the Mount Whateverest, but please use an electrical train."
"my next car in a couple of years, once they get the range up"
"So, one month in, hows your efficiency? I was hoping that your range, with 19"" wheels, would be between 275-300 miles.... Any additional thoughts you have on the car? Thanks"
Best car ever made!!!!
So how does it compare to the Model S and 3? Better? Worse?
Bmw the best
nice look
"2,000lbs heavier on Winter Tires - ties SF90 at 10.0 dead and keeps pace in a half mile. EVs are something else. As soon as we start producing performance cars with EV engines (proper suspensions, chassiss, and aero) these cars are going to be stupid levels of speed/capabilities."
Thats one fast minivan. I still dont understand why people buy the Plaid versions at all. The normal are fast enough. I see people moving from decidedly non-performance vehicles to Tesla P or Plaid models. Nuts.
Did they use winter tires on the Model X again?
* 1st Run: 5:05 * Ferrari Solo Launch: 5:48 * 2nd Run: 6:13 * 3rd Run: 6:50 * 4th Run: 7:47 - 1/2 mile 50 mph rolling start race * 5th Run: 9:35 - Second 1/2 mile 50 mph rolling start race * 6th Run: 10:48 - 100 mph brake test
"Tesla is my favourite one. Maybe my opinion is subjective like in video below. [ Also, if you have some similar videos on other car brands like this one, reply the comment."
"350 km in giornata? Andata/ritorno? Succede di doverli fare due giorni consecutivi? Sempre la stessa tratta? Ci sono supercharger sulla tratta? E soprattutto, hai possibilità di caricare una volta a casa?"
"Autostrada è il terreno peggiore per l’elettrico, 350km e ‘spesso’ non fanno ben sperare. Mettici di farlo con temperature invernali al nord Italia e allora ti direi che saresti veramente al limite anche con la versione con batteria top. Però non la possiedo"
Al massimo ti fermi 15 minuti al supercharge e sei apposto super tranquillo;€
"Io ho una Long Range dal 2019. Se pensi di prendere la versione base puoi farcela, devi guidare sotto i 120km/h e essere sicuro di avere un posto dove caricare a destinazione. Al limite puoi far un rabbocco con FreetoX in autogrill."
"Fossi in te andrei su reddit Tesla per avere più opinioni di possessori in merito. Sulla carta dovresti farcela senza non troppi problemi, lideale sarebbe poter provare di persona, ma noleggiare Tesla è bello costoso."
Ma non vi rendete conto di quanto sia profondamente sbagliato doversi fare certi calcoli prima di acquistare serenamente un auto? Vi sembra davvero normale e sano diventare schiavi dell’autonomia?
"Prendi una long range e vai tranquillo. LE batterie si degradano un 5% il primo anno, poi perdi 1% lanno. Con la pompa di calore stai abbastanza sereno. A 120km/h fai 480 km A 130 ne fai 400. La tua serenità mentale e portafoglio ringrazieranno. Considera se hai famiglia una model Y."
"Io guarderei ad altre elettriche considerato il livello degli assemblaggi di Tesla, dei problemi di assistenza e delle vere e proprie truffe commesse dalla compagnia (pacchetto guida autonoma lo paghi oggi e lo usi nel duemilamai)."
350km in autostrada e pure spesso è una condanna a morte per lelettrico. Prenditi un diesel se fai tutti sti km che per i prossimi 15 anni ti porterà ovunque tu voglia
"Noi abbiamo una Model 3 da tre anni (Standarrd Range). Per il tuo chilometraggio forse sarebbe meglio la Long Range, ma cè la potresti fare anche con la Standard. Prima avevamo un BMW dieselone e non cè proprio paragone in quanto a comodità sulle distanze, La Tesla è un altro mondo."
"Il Nord Italia è probabilmente il terreno migliore per fare quel tragitto con unauto elettrica MA, lascia perdere, veramente. Levoluzione dellelettrico è letteralmente inevitabile, acquistare ad oggi unauto elettrica (ed io ne possiedo una) non ha senso, non se sei una persona che si sposta tanto e non vuole programmare il viaggio fino allultimo centesimo. Inoltre, tolti i supercharger, non conviene manco troppo. Il prezzo al kW (in abbonamento, non a consumo) è in costante aumento e rapportato al prezzo attuale di diesel e benzina, se anche ci risparmiassi 20 euro al mese, non valgono le menate, le attese, lansia di arrivare ad una colonnina e trovarla non funzionante. Mi aspetto nei prossimi anni batterie decisamente più capienti e tecnologie di ricarica (e prezzi) più accessibili di quelle attuali che, tolti i supercharger, sono veramente il far west. Detto questo, se tu avessi già unaltra auto con la quale andare a farti un giro quando non vuoi menate con le colonnine , il discorso sarebbe del tutto differente e probabilmente la tesla, nel mondo delle elettriche, sarebbe la scelta più furba."
"Ti dico una curiosità su Tesla: rifiutano controlli extra aziendali sull’’affidabilità delle vetture. Si stima siano in fondo alla classifica di molto, e in fondo ci stanno Alfa Romeo e Jeep, veda lei."
Compra una Toyota. Tesla non è del mestiere.
"Un amico ha una Tesla, mi pare model 3 e fa spesso Aosta genova a/r ma dice che al ritorno si ferma a caricare dopo il turchino perchè non si fida. Edit, lui ha il piede pesante però. La cosa che mi chiedo della TEsla però è, e lassitenza? Non è che poi la si deve portare chissà dove?"
"Io ho la Model 3 base da ormai quasi 4 anni. Ho un’attività lavorativa che mi porta spesso fuori provincia: Brescia, Milano, un paio di volte Torino. I viaggi non sono un problema la macchina ti pianifica tutto, ma il massimo che ho fatto senza fermarmi è Torino-Brescia tutta autostrada ai 120 (308km). Ok, magari quelle nuove hanno un po’ più autonomia (la mia ne dichiara 400 km) PERÒ! se la tiri così tanto devi assolutamente caricare dove arrivi, e spesso è una ricerca miserabile, conviene fermarsi dove c’è un supercharger per un caffè 10 minuti e ti tira l’auto dal 30 al 70% Se avessi avuto più disponibilità avrei preso una Long Range, quando la cambierò non sarà per una standard."
Hmmm this color and the white color makes it look sharp. What made you decide to ditch the model 3? Range anxiety?
Do a pros and cons post comparing the Tesla to Honda! Would love your insight after a couple more miles on the accord.
[Engine](
"Get some ceramic window tint, big difference in the summer"
I almost got a Tesla as well a couple years ago and ended up with a Touring Hybrid. Im an anxious person anyway and the more I read about range-anxiety I knew I would easily be consumed by it.
Sport and Up is the better car IMHO
"I dont know what it is but, I just cant get used to look of the body style on this gen Accord. When I first seen the 10th gen Accord body styles, I fell in love with it and wanted one for years. In 2020 I finally got my wish and love it! But this 11th gen Accord just, I dont know. Something about the body style just screams ""nothing special here""."
The exterior look is growing on me. Didnt like it at first. The interior looks like more of a luxury car compared to the 10th gen.
The color does look nice! Congrats!!
Such a sleek looking car. Congrats.
I want to like this car so bad. But it just seems like such a step back from the 10th gen
Better choice huh ?
"Also curious to hear your thoughts. I am about to take delivery for a model 3 next week and am having second thoughts mostly due to the nuisance of settjng up chargers at home, and leaning towards the Accord Hybrid Sport. Any differences to point out besides the lack of chargers (which isn’t an issue in my area luckily)?"
Why didn’t you go for the hybrid trims?
[deleted]
Any specific reason you decided to switch?
Clean bro. Nice whip!!!
Can’t go wrong wit a Honda

"Man this website is plagued with ads. I was troubleshooting something yesterday and had AdGuard turned off. All these ads make browsing this website unintuitive. Any ways for the actual source, seems like this is the tweet:  Anyone else notice couple of wires coming out from the rear door?"
I purchased a 2023 Model 3 and I chose the 19” sport wheels…I powder coated them black…looks like they are finally doing away with the last bit of silver-ish tones/colors on the vehicle (also heard the T emblems will be black on the refresh as well)
Looks like that front one has some nice curb damage
Good looking wheel.
I hope the aero wheels (cover) also look better
i’m pretty sure they are asymmetric between left and right sets :(
These look terrible compared to the Aeros with cap kit…
"Great, another set of wheels that can turn directions depending on left or right, due to only one mould......... If they wont make left and right, make them so they can be used on both sides without looking different!"
they look like a cheap modded civic wheel :/ shame
[deleted]
Wonder what the 19 inch wheels will look like.
I just took delivery of my M3... :(
This whole chrome delete and make everything black trend is going to going to make these cars look dated in 5-10 years.
[deleted]
Yeeeee centerlock style wheels like the inductions
Back to chrome door handles?
stop tagging this shitty ass website. it’s like cancer
So wait. The computer knows when a window is out of calibration. Why doesnt it just...................you know................calibrate it?
My drivers window does this thing where when I close it by raising and releasing the button it goes up for a split second but then retracts back down all the way. Last mobile service I had the tech recalibrated it but this still happens on occasion. Anyone else experience this?
Thanks! Hopefully this solves my right rear window randomly rolling down an inch or two when the car is parked.
"Pro tip, recalibrate the windows on a cold day. The seals get stiff when it gets cold and causes a lot of reversing when the window gets all the way up, as it ends up seeing resistance earlier than expected and interprets it as an obstacle. Also window reversing while driving in bumpy roads is considered normal, the pinch protection is just too sensitive."
Does putting your car in service mode void warranty or anything?
"Great, manually calibrating windows, manually adjusting one headlight at a time, manually turning dimmed mirrors on and of. Love this super high tech car!"
"I need this for Model S. I constantly get ""Window down"" notifications from the app when I *know* all windows are closed."
Its the free color option.
"""California Camry"""
I have a white car. Not a Tesla. I bought it in summer when it was 100 degrees out and white seemed like the least-hot option (coolest doesn’t seem like the right word.) I do notice there are a lot of white cars in general here.
"As someone irritated with Teslas and Musk, I will give credit where its due. Remember the dude that drove his (white) model 3 off a damn cliff to try to kill his family? Bay area coast, several months ago or so. The fuckin thing somehow landed perfectly and all four in the car survived. It looked like a drop of several hundred feet. I was impressed."
Lol because it’s the free color option 😭
Free color option + BMW 3series owners moved on to model 3s
Model 3’s everyyyyywherrrrrreee nowwww
"Pro tip: if you drive a white Tesla, you have the right to drive at exactly the speed limit in the HOV or passing lane during long commutes."
"The tax incentive was like $7,400 with free software upgrades I think."
This is like being mad about seeing grey 2010 Toyota Corollas everywhere. Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon Kidding. There are a shit ton of white Teslas out there
Probably because theres a lot of people buying White Tesla model 3s
"I have one and it’s the funnest car I’ve owned. It fast, silent, and drives itself on long highway trips. The range is way better than any other EV. I ain’t paying 1-2k for a color option, white is the best looking color anyway. I don’t think I’m better than other people, I just bought it because it’s a cool car and supporting a company that’s a few miles from where I live is a bonus. People just focus on the bad Tesla drivers now because there are so many Teslas on the road."
Those are BAPs. Bay Area Prius. White ones are driven by people who go to 31 flavors and get vanilla.
The Valley has always been early adopters of The Next Big Thing That’ll Change The World.
Why do people still buy teslas when they’re built so poorly?
"Same reason theres so many white lexus is’s in sj, asians love white cars."
It’s the cheapest option for them to feel superior over others. Always makes me laugh when I see so much attitude coming out of a 3 😂
Thanks for offsetting the carbon from my twin turbo Dino burner.
"Honestly, any white Tesla. It’s the, “I make money in tech and I want to show it off but I don’t know how.” Edit: So many salty Tesla owners in the comments section, lol"
Its the new trashy yet luxury car. Theyre like Beemers. You avoid interacting with the driver as much as possible to avoid the shine of his shit eating grin.
"bc people are rich entitled pricks who can’t drive and need a self driving car, WHICH CANT EVEN DRIVE PROPERLY"
Was hoping we would leave the Tesla trend in 2022.
Disgusting drivers.
More like white model 3 & Ys.
ok I thought it was just me
Looks like a vibrator
Love! So pretty!
Came here to read all the negative comments. Pleasantly surprised that there was only one. Nice look.
Gorgeous!!
What would be the going rate for a model y?
"Wow, this is the best Tesla color mod Ive seen till date. Love it!!"
"Even if you offered to wrap my car like that for free, thats still a 👎 from me."
Does your shop do tint? I’m in Irving lol
SupremeWraps 😎
Gorgeous! How long would you expect a satin wrap to hold up to the elements?
Smash.
I swear I saw this yesterday in Houston.
"OP, how much did this cost?"
ooh.. Looks like Supreme Wraps Dallas! (they did my wifes car)
Nobody show this to my wife!
"From that angle, it looks like youve done a pillar delete, got any other angles of it? Looks good!"
"Sorry that happened, it’s a bad situation for sure. You shouldn’t be carless, insurance should provide you with a rental until your car is done."
"Shop around there is a place I went to in Noho, that Tesla recommended that did $11k of work in two weeks and it was finished one day ahead of promised! They do nothing but Teslas either. All city collision"
Sorry to hear. That is hard to watch. Is it normal for big rigs to drive around this area?
That sucks so much. My car just got broken into last night so I sympathize with you. I wonder if anyone can make out the writing on the door and the license plate so that you can go after the driver and their employer. Do you have rental car coverage?
"I had a trucking companies mud flap fly off and completely destroy my front bumper and grille. Snapped a pic of the truck missing it’s mud flap and it matching up to my car along with their license plate. Company paid for my rental for almost 60 days while car was in the shop as well as all the damage. Pretty crazy the guy didn’t stop, he’s definitely losing his job"
doesnnt the car have a good video to provide information to identify the trucking company? The truck company seems pretty clear in the beginning.
"I’m sure you already have done this, but Send this video to the trucking company for the claim ( your insurance should do this). They can easily figure out who it was. Guarantee he didn’t even know it happening, but as a driver you should always get out and look before backing."
Did you get a ticket for parking in the fire lane? 😅
"Man that truck driver is an idiot; they should’ve stopped and did the right thing. They’re going to lose their job over this for sure. Hope you’re made whole in the process, what a nightmare."
"Weirdest trailer, never seen one like that, in addition to the odd axle location is it also longer than the usual ones?"
"Wow. That is terrible and infuriating. I hope you get fully compensated for your losses here, and that truck driver loses their CDW and goes to jail. But the gallows humor side of me wants to say, ""Ouch! Look at the curb rash on those wheels!"""
Geez that car got DRAGGED!! 😭😭😭
Ahaha
Sorry this happened to you. Would be a perfect submission to the new Wham Baam SecurityCam channel on YT
Will look into it
"What a fucking joke of a company he’s turned Tesla into. I saw a dude on here who’s seat belt anchors fell apart leaving him with no driver seat belt. He’s lucky it happened when it did, imagine if he actually needed the seatbelt? He’d be dead. FYI, if you have a Tesla. Check your seatbelts. Seriously. Don’t just assume your seatbelt is functional."
Musk announces steering wheel ejector button software upgrade so everyone can join in the fun.

Im surprised Elon didnt call him a pedo.
Best brand ever 😀
"Another case of Tofu-Dreg Car. Which is what Teslas are. I hope he enjoy the workshop service, which has the same degree as quality controls. Imagine why they are dropping in price, their cheap plastic jumbles. ##"
"Lol (literally made me lol) this is the first time Ive ever heard of this kind of problem in any modern car. And this is supposedly new, not yknow a few years old with 0 maintenance."
Is the steering shaft a 1/2 pvc pipe glued on?
They should make a car where the steering-wheel doesn’t fly off
Its the new full self drive system beta update 1.8776344 .. unfortunately he didnt opt out of it
"User error, obviously"
Honestly if anyone is still hyping up teslas and planning to buy them I don’t even know what to say to them. They’ll either literally fall apart or burn up. Also people in the replies to the tweet are trying to say he removed the wheel himself to try and get at Elon/Tesla. Yeah let me buy a brand new car from this company and remove the steering wheel that’ll show them!
Literal toys.
a beeautiful esteering wheel that do not whiff out the window while I driving
A steering wheel that doesn FALL OFF when you are driving
"Such garbage. I can’t believe fanboys still crave him. Especially when he first bought Twitter. They also forgot to put brake pads on some lady’s car, she called to say her brakes sounded bad, Tesla tech on the phone said she was fine. She took it to a brake shop? No pads. She wouldn’t have been able to stop on the highway, if she’d trusted the Tesla “technician”."
"There was a greek architect, Mesodides, that submitted plans to build a temple to the Committee on Building Greek Temples. The committee said it was unsound and needed more columns. The architect insisted that it did not. The committee said that unless he had extra columns, they would not approve the temple. So Mesodides added the columns, but he never connected them to the roof -- the were functionally useless. That temple? The Acropolis of Athens. Musk is just a modern day Mesodides. People say FSD doesnt work, that it will kill people. Musk disagrees. The government tells him he cant sell a car that is FSD, that it must have a steering wheel for a driver to manipulate. So Musk, in his genius, includes a steering wheel in all his cars, but does not connect it."
"“We’ve looked into the super secret logs that only we can see, and can say with confidence that autopilot was not engaged at the time of the incident, therefore it is not the fault of Tesla that the steering wheel fell off. And yes we’re totally telling the truth about the logs, and no you can’t see them”"
Best part: They tried charging the owner $103 for a new steering wheel
Tesla’s build quality is trash don’t buy one
Tesla quality
How about a steering wheel that doesnt fly off when youre driving? YOU HAVE NO GOOD CAR IDEAS!
Link : [
This is just preparing for fsd 13 or whatever. No longer need humans the car drives itself
And the [Tesla Model S that spontaneously caught fire while driving down the highway](
That December Tesla Magic.
"Thats a new feature. Next update, the AI will ask you to take off the steering wheel once Full self driving is engaged."
"Built by hopes, dreams and imaginary market capitalization."
Poor quality
"""Driver must always has hands on the wheel"". ALWAYS? Like forever?"
And this would be just a small issue with a Tesla. Any other car manufacturer would have been laughed out of existence
Teslas are self driven so no harm no foul
"See, tesla had an amazing car.. Elon Musk thought so too and invested a ton of money and took over the company......and now steering wheels fall off their cars"
We hope we didn’t lose you as a loyal customer.
"Hey, its a self driving car now! *pop*"
Best part is Tesla charged him for the repair
Shouldve had a focus group with the guy from *I Think You Should Leave* who recommended a steering wheel that doesnt fly off when youre driving
 There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye.
This is why you [don’t drink and drive]( even in a Tesla. You never know when you need your wits about you.
That sounds pretty disruptive. Mission accomplished.
"Things need fixing is actually the first thing you do when you pick up your cars Well, ALL my friend who bought Tesla had to mark where it needs fixing when they picked it up. Oh, and all of them Tesla have thing to be fixed regardless of model"
Did you see the 4th quarter profits?
The cognitive overhead required to run Tesla is very low
Concerning.
Cheap american made cars babyyyyy
It fell off outside of the environment.
"You don’t need a steering wheel if the car drives itself - that’s a feature, not a failure"
You gotta be a special kind of stupid to be buying a Tesla at this point.
"At this point, I’d feel safer in a Pinto."
"Not surprising. And Tesla swears up and down that its FSD system, which has been in beta mode forever, is reliable, safe, can think faster than our brain, and see better than our eyes for $16G extra! Sure, Elon!!! I’m still waiting for the fucking windshield wipers on my Tesla M3 to work properly!!! Tesla also needs to stop messing with user interface settings in its updates and give users options to reject or accept these changes. Turning in the M3 in August. Don’t know what EV I’ll get next but never getting another Tesla."
Using autopilot on a Tesla is irresponsible and using FSD is just looking for death/serious injury.
This is like cartoon levels of incompetence now

"New Zealand recently had a cyclone (hurricane for you Northerners) that took out the power grid due to extensive flooding in the area. There were a number of local articles highlighting those with BYD Atto 3s, MG ZS EVs and Ioniq 5/EV6 vehicles being able to power their essentials via V2L from the car while waiting the few days it took to repair the grid connections. I can definitely see the benefit of having that functionality in an emergency situation. Its not necessarily about powering the entire house with it."
"I think the biggest deal is being able to do virtual power grid to add the cars in a major grid event, cars could stabilize the grid for hours at a time. Enough to make the repairs and get it back online maybe."
"My car is in the garage 95% of the time. We do have a powerwall. If were not home, it should power our home for two days without solar which would never be the case. I would be good to, as Elon said, be able to use the car as the supplementary storage."
"I find it odd that Elon frames this capability as though people intend, intentionally, to power houses from their car’s battery for extended durations. And he also throws in a “Umm, why not just use a power wall?” Like, dude, maybe my circumstances are such that it’s just nice to know my car _could_, in an emergency, help me out."
"Elon’s reaction to that timeline 👀 Guessing that might be a little ambitious, we’ll see."
"so your car will act as a powerwall, will it affect powerwall sales?"
"Here is what happened: - Tesla was caught off-guard by a question about bidirectional charging, which they obviously did not have a plan for. - One of the Tesla guys says something equivalent to “Uh-oh… In a couple years?” - Elon cuts him off and explains why bidirectional charging is not a good idea in his opinion. Next, in the news: “Tesla will have bidirectional charging in 2025.” I continue to be amazed by everyone’s over-interpretation of any comment from Elon or Tesla staff."
"I was surprised that Musky was dismissive of the idea. Its less of a will x% of people use it daily and more of thank god I have this when I need it Austin itself, the HQ of Tesla itself, had power outages lasting a week a few winters ago and this last winter. Every single person sitting in the dark then will be thinking about this when choosing between a car that can power their house for a few days and one that cant"
"a large majority of tesla owners have two cars. I appreciate this is a first world comment. depending on how much it costs to get the bi-directional, I would get it. I would simply drive my other car if I needed to leave the house during a power outage and leave the tesla plugged in."
"Some pretty boneheaded framing from Musk given there’s more to bidirectionality than vehicle-to-home, as demonstrated in this [new MIT study on vehicle-to-grid export]( What’s not clear is whether customers will be in the right place at the right time, and have the right understanding, to take advantage of time-based export incentives. Or whether Bagliano is right and smart unidirectional charging when real-time power prices are low can achieve 99% of the cost savings for both customers and grid operators that V2G would garner 🤔"
"I’d love to charge my car battery through the night, drive to work during the day, and then power my house from 5-8pm when electricity with the SCE Time-of-Use 5-8pm in my area (when electricity is most expensive)"
"Musk doesnt want to support this idea because he thinks its far better to just have a powerwall. Also it means people will not buy a powerwall if they are worried about emergency power and just rely on their car. But Tesla still will do it because their competition will do it. Though because the CEO is not pushing it, it will take 2 years to come to market. I do think Musk has a point that if you want to take advantage of their virtual powerplant/Tesla Energy systems it works a lot better if their battery doesnt go off to the store occasionally. Ultimately it doesnt matter because Ford has in the F150 so Tesla will be stupid not to add it."
Amazing that the galaxy brain genius sells power walls but cant comprehend someone wanting to use their car that sits 99% of its existence as a home battery.
I also don’t use my airbag often but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be a feature.
$3000 v2l adapter to make it work like everyone else
I’d be happy to just plug my fridge and some lights in during a disaster.
If your heard what they said you wouldnt exactly call that an announcement...
"I feel like Elon missed the point. I think it would be fantastic to be able to use a car battery to power a gas furnace in colder climates during major power outages, without having to invest so much going full solar + powerwall."
I expect to be able to use it as much as possible. Intending on buying one in future. hw4 and Bi directional charging sound like good reasons to hold off.
Be nice if you can charge another Ev with another Ev
"I have a 2500W 12V inverter that I can hook up to my model 3 for emergencies, and it works properly, but this is a WAY better method."
Car Batteries are just more expensive to buy and repair. I would happily use it in emergencies but not for every day grid stabilisation. Tesla Powerwall may be 1000 usd per kwh but go to china and you buy 10 kwh battery packs (lfp) for 2500 usd.
"It makes sense why Elon is against that idea. Teslas battery warranty is based on using your car for driving. If you plugged in your car and used it as a powerwall, Tesla would lose money on higher than expected battery warranty claims."
Would be kind of cool if I could charge another Tesla that may have ran out of juice on the side of the road with my tesla
"I think hes basing this on the fact that the roadster had the ability and wasnt used... but we are in a very different time in terms of EVs and solar adoption. While I wouldnt buy the car solely for this reason, I certainly wouldnt hate the option. Los Angeles area just had tens of thousands without power, some for days. With solar supplementing, a tesla battery could easily power a house for days, if not ""forever"" with solar supplementing the consumption. Here in MA I can almost live even in the winter with just my solar array and two power walls."
"Well no shit it wont be widespread. Its not like I regularly have a need to power my house with batteries. I rarely lose power, and when I do its usually less than an hour. But that rare time every couple of years where I lose power for 4+ hours? Hell yes, I will absolutely use the car to power the house. And when I go to buy my next vehicle, which will certainly be electric, bi-directional charging will be a MAJOR factor. Its not about using this feature all the time, its about having this feature when you really need it."
"VTG is not difficult. Ford managed to pull it off quickly. All it needs is an Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) and a large inverter. Tesla already has an ATS called the Tesla Gateway. It is used on all Powerwall installations to automatically cut off the electrical connection to the grid which is required by law when you are sending your own power onto your local house circuits and have the potential to back-feed power into the grid while while the grid is down. Tesla already has a large inverter. It is installed as part of Tesla solar or one is built-into the Powerwall 2. This means that they already make and sell most of the components to enable this. The easiest way for Tesla to do this would be to require that the location already have the gateway and at least one Powerwall. It would then add a DC input from the car charger to the Powerwall battery using a DC to DC converter that the Powerwall could enable for up to 5kW per Powerwall or DC to AC in the Tesla solar inverter when the Powerwalls get to low charge and the car is at high charge. That would require minimal changes to the Powerwall, to the car charger, and to the car to feed power backwards when enabled. If the power was to be sent to the grid, the Powerwall would do that just like it does it today with the Tesla virtual powerplant. A few software changes for the config to be enabled or disabled and the charge levels to activate and deactivate it and its all done."
"The challenge isn’t the cars, the challenge is that V2G costs a fortune to install - $3-4k more than a standard car charger installed, because it requires major electrical work on top of the high cost of bidirectional chargers. Plus of course the drawback that you lose power when you go for a drive."
He is not wrong. I do not see I will spend thousand dollars to make my house take advantage of this feature. Sure I might plug-in a plug to lit my house but it really does not make sense economic wise to install on every car
"This is a good development. V2L is a requirement for our next EV, if were going to spend a lot on an EV."
"Im confused why they would claim that unplugging your car would turn off electricity in your house. is this some weird American thing? the battery systems i know of in Europe work while your house is grid connected, and simply supply enough power so you dont pull anything from the grid. turning that off would not be noticable, as any load will simply pull from the grid instead of the batter."
They wont offer it until forced by competition Powerwall will die instantly
"Best solution here is if you have powerwall you can charge them with the car, like Elon said when you unplug the house from the car now the house is dark and inconveniencing your family leaving them in the dark."
"This calculation by use rate is kinda dumb in cases where emergencies are the use case (and inherently rare). Same with the dumb idea to remove lumbar support in passenger seats. The demographic leans young so of course its not used yet. If the car lasts long, it will be used later."
"I have no idea what he meant by ""your house will go dark"""
"Unless they triple the battery capacity, this has near zero use"
[removed]
Could we make money from it ? I have a lifetime free charging tesla s. Could I sell that energy?
To have your car power your house you’ll need a high wattage inverter. These are often more expensive than a traditional backup generator. You can get a really decent one for under $5k.
"I have to agree with Elon, bidirectional charging for the most part is pretty stupid. Usually when you need backup power at home you also need your vehicle to work. In fact if the power outage is the result of natural disasters you will need that vehicle to clear the area or to help with getting facilities back on line. In fact it is during these outages when the ability to charge from a home backup system become important. So yeah pretty stupid."
Of course he didnt because he is so out of touch with the company. Elon needs to go. Holding tesla back now
I never thought about the car just having a DC out to an outboard inverter - thats a cool idea. Dont add much if any cost to the car but allow for it to be used if needed if someone wants to spend that $$.
They did cancel sunroof based on usage…
I have 2 Powerwalls and the number of days a year where I can fill those from the bottom and still generate more energy is minimal. Im not eager to cycle the cars batteries though for minimal gain.
I dunno. If they can integrate this with VPP/autobidder ths seems like a whole lot of grid storage coming on line in short order. That could be worth mucho dinero for the ciustomer and Tesla.
"Narrator in 2026: Telsa models didnt, but Elon promised it would be released ""real soon"""
I could see this being used to lower daytime power usage. with a power wall and a tesla you could run your house all day and then charge them up at night. further offset with home solar. Could also be interesting for someone living off grid but works/shops near a supercharger to top off their house.
"For us it would make sense without a powerwall as well, just as a backup power source in case of a hurricane. Even without solar this is great to have. I would buy a generator or a powerwall but the cost is high and already have electric cars purchased."
Its a cool feature. But it mutes the resale confidence on battery use in comparison to mileage. Each discharge that isnt driving is still equivalent to adding mileage to the battery pack. I dont think you can have a million mile Tesla and use your Tesla as a power plant.
I’d use it in an emergency. But I’ll be getting solar/power walls soon to replace my annoying gas generator.
I would have used it last night when lost power in storms.
Does a home need special wiring to be able to accept the reverse power….clearly i know nothing about electrical
"At the moment, the home L2 charger is a pretty simple piece of equipment. If you want to power your home from the car, youd have to, at very least, install a transfer box that breaks the connection to the grid when you switch to having the car powering the house. This is so that you dont energize the network outside your house; doing so while repairs are underway is incredibly dangerous to the workers trying to fix downed wires. Going the full V2G route, with your car battery part of the network power backup, is far more complex, and would require a gateway in your house, similar to that used by solar-to-grid systems, to manage load and connection. This runs into money."
"Sidenote, there will be millions of people going to free charging stations and then sending the power back to their house/grid just to save a few bucks a day"
"Oh man, Elon’s reply is just so out of touch with reality. He sounds like a guy who’s never experienced a power outage before. Oh no! I can’t drive (one of) my cars without inconveniencing my house. As if that’s remotely comparable to not being able to stay warm, boil water, have lights and keep a fridge cold when it’s parked there. At least give people the option. And I’m guessing most household that own Teslas have more than one car. And even then power outages happen at night time, during holidays, on weekends, and other times, when you don’t necessarily have to drive fairly often. Oh yeah, and I can always walk or ride a bike. Comparing the level of convenience gained by using your already purchased Tesla to buying multiple power walls with solar for $50,000 is just ridiculous. If Tesla doesn’t jump on this soon I’m sure every other auto manufacturer will. That’s a huge increased value for your cars. Whether or not Tesla wants to cannibalize a bit of the power wall market, they really won’t have a choice and will have to offer this in the future if anyone else does before them anyway."
"Clown, should have enabled this by default. Especially if you look at all the congestie networks in Europe. For true sustainability every car by law should be bi directional charging with x% of the battery dedicated for imbalances in the grid. Which should be compensated by for lower taxes (i mean in Europe we are already givjng them a ton of freebies)."
"V2L for own consumption make sense. V2G does not as the pure economical compensation is not high enough for a person to use one’s limited lifecycle battery, not to mention the extra hardware one need to build at a house."
Wouldnt it also be helpful if your friend stranded his EV on the roadside and needed a bit of juice?
Glad its being done. I was thinking that they were shying away to prevent it cutting into their home battery business
We have power shut-off events here in SoCal when there’s fire danger from forecasted high wind conditions. Would be nice to be able to use some of that huge battery on my Model Y for essentials
"It isnt something I ever WANT to use, but after a hurricane, Ill be grateful for it."
"People dont tend to use nat gas or diesel generators in a widespread fashion. They also dont make a habit of using the small (hopefully) empty gas tank that they might have in their trunk. V2H, V2V, V2G would all be very nice to have when needed, even if its not that often."
Under one of those covered products is the next gen powerwall
"Its more complicated than just pluging your car into the house and turning it on. Batteries are generally setup to handle specific loads, not just anything that needs power. You also have to have inverters that convert the power needed, these are generally sized to handle the specific loads youre trying to offset. So while the functionality may exist, I totally see his point that most people wont invest in the infastructure neede to make it work. Guessing those that already have solar (along with inverters and batteries) may a get a lot more use out of this feature."
retrofit?
"So for background, we have 2 Teslas, 8 kw solar system (Enphase), 30kwh storage (Enphase LFP). I think all this talk about di-direction charging is way simplified by people like Elon and tech articles. The reality of things is that in order to be able to do this, home infrastructure needs some major changes in 99% of cases. When we installed our battery backup system, I couldnt believe the number of sub-panels, smart switches, battery disconnects, etc that we had to install not to mention main panel upgrades (even though we had 220 amp already). Also the sheer number of inspections that we had to do was astounding. If you think about it, it makes sense because while in our minds it sounds simple (ie when sun is shining, power first goes to home use, then to charge the battery, then to charge the car, when power is down, start using battery and go off grid but still take in power from the panels to the battery when offgrid), it is actually very complicated to direct electricity that way while taking into account the safety of line workers during an outage. Even after its said and done, our system cant direct electricity from solar to the battery AND the house at the same time, so in the morning when our batteries are down to 30% from a night of offgrid power (I switch to battery 100% when sun goes down), the panels charge the batteries but if you use appliances, the power has to come from the grid because theres no way to direct certain watts to the battery while also sending some to appliances. So if you think Tesla is just gonna flip a swtich and make their vehicles capable of V2H, its not gonna be simple at all to make your house ready to take that power. Another issue is that there isnt a standardize way that I am aware of to set this system up, it seems like every home battery company is doing their own thing with their own gateway etc. &#x200B; Another problem with V2H is the sheer inefficiency of it all. Power is generated as DC current across the panel and inverted to AC for home use (in my case Microinverters which inverts at the panel). When charging the car, the cars internal charger inverts the AC back to DC for storage in the battery. Then if you use V2H, the power has to come out of the battery and inverted again for Home use (DC to AC). Now imagine if this is going on all day with small losses every time there is an inversion. Home batteries are even worse sometimes because I will stored solar power during the (DC to AC to DC) then charge the car with the electricity at night (DC to AC to DC)."
"Grrr... 4 Powerwalls in September 2022, and now you tell me?"
V2G. I expect the cyber truck to have this but i am worried it’s not designed into it yet.
"I wouldnt use it daily, thats for sure. However, it would be nice to have the option to power my house during a blackout. I hate setting up that gas generator on the very rare occasion when I lose power."
Yes please
Most power outages in my area (Boston suburb) last only a few hours. It would be very convenient to use the car as a backup generator.
"Hes wrong, it has many uses, particularly in natural disasters!"
Very thorough!
"As an American, i thought non-tesla public charging in Europe is much better than the US. Is that not the case?"
Also have a MYP. I got the martian 19” wheels and they made a world of difference in ride comfort and improved range. Sold the uberturbines with tires for a good chunk of change as well. Love the car.
"> god damn I hate those uberturbines combined with my citys infrastructure (aka the rim destroyers). Find another Tesla owner with 18"" wheels, whos a sucker for outward appearances and wants the bigger wheels. Do a straight swap. Youll both be happy, until the other owner also realises big rims have many practical drawbacks."
great post.
"This is the thing that brings the smile to most Tesla owners face ""Stupidly fast and dangerous in the wrong hands, but fun nonetheless""."
"Nice comparison! Ive been considering trading my Model 3 for something bigger and with *any* towing capacity (in the US) so this was a helpful comparison. The features you get from Teslas EAP over standard autopilot are definitely nice, if only because you get lane changes. I cant believe basic auto lane changes still arent in standard autopilot. The ioniq 5 even has auto lane changes standard with HDA2."
"I think you should spend more time with the MYs audio system - its worlds better than the ID.4. I made the exact same switch and the ID.4s system felt lifeless by comparison. No sensitivity at lower volumes, lack of power/clarity, and no dedicated subwoofer. The Tesla has hundreds more watts at its disposal as well. Its a pretty common complaint on the ID.4 forums that it sounds like a base Jetta inside. :-) They are two *very* different systems."
Not sure how/if it works in EU but a big reason we bought EAP was for the car to change lanes while on autopilot.
"Really great write up, I appreciate you sharing it."
"Thanks for the detailed review! I hope you enjoy your new Y. Dont mind the downvotes, thats just how this sub is twords Tesla."
How could your relationship to Apple possibly be relevant to this
"I am thinking about ordering MY long range, but the suspension and, especially, noise insulation is something I am worrying about. I have an actual BMW 3 series now and due to ADAC (German Automobile club), the noise in the MY is 68 Decibel at 130 km/h and only 65,4 in actual 3 Series. And this is one quality I like in premium cars very much, I like that we can speak with my wife quietly when cruising at 150-160 km/h, with music silently playing in the background. I am really asking how the OP is finding MY quieter than any ICE?! There are plenty of them, especially at highway speeds. I took ID3 several days ago and it was awful compared to BMW. Already at 140 I have to make music pretty load against wind noise. Guys, do some of you tried MY made in Berlin? Are they any better in noise insulation?"

"If you dont put much thought into the table, it seems like Tesla is winning easily. But, if you consider that:- VW software problems can be fixed with updates, and they are already putting really much effort into it (one can just read about VW OS, Cariad, etc.) \- VW app should work better in the future (same as above) \- Noise/sound isolation factor is really an important thing, it puts you in better mood, makes you more relaxed, etc. \- Problems with charging should become quite soon a much smaller problem - Tesla will open their chargers, and huge money are going right now towards increasing charging networks capabilities. Networks will probably solve their software problems, too. Just a matter of fixing bugs. &#x200B; ... then it really is a much more difficult decision - which car is better. In my opinion, it comes down to - do you want softer suspension, more relaxed driving experience - or do you want less relaxing, but sportier and funnier car? Edit: Im just speculating, of course, especially regarding the software and charging networks. Just my guess Edit2: If you want to downvote, how about a constructive comment instead? Lets have some respect to each other. Or at least explain, why youre downvoting."

"I will never get over my classmate telling me that I should ""Just buy a Tesla!"" because I was talking about how expensive medical school is. My family comes from major poverty, and as much as they love me and want to support me, they cant help me financially. She told me to Just Buy A Tesla If Youre So Worried About Money. In *Canada*. In the ***winter.*** Her dads a heart surgeon and bought her a brand new car for med school. Her friend talked about how they was jealous that their dad, a urologist, bought their younger sibling a second Bentley after they wrecked the first one in less than a month of having it, because the aforementioned friend only got their one car and was not given the opportunity to get a nicer one. I didnt even know how to respond to that"

CTS-V didnt exist in 2021 or after. It was a CT5-V or an older year CTS-V
"Looks like the previous owner had battery replacement anxiety, trading it in as the warranty expired."
Taking it to the Car Wizard’s shop in the next episode to see everything wrong with it and then putting it in a series of competitions with your friends in their cheapest model in the US too?
I love how people still apply ICE logic to out of warranty Teslas. These batteries are designed to last 300k to 500k miles. And all other fixes are pretty cheap.
"…or cheapest on Autotrader at the time I bought it. A little less than two weeks ago, I picked up a 2018 Model 3 LR AWD for $25k from a dealer here in Atlanta. It has 121k miles, basic autopilot, and 277 miles of range on a full charge. It’s definitely not perfect… It has a couple dings, some decent curb rash, and a handful of touched up chips on the nose. I’ve put about 1000 miles on it since I picked it up and so far it has been rock solid. I’m really hoping it qualifies for the used EV tax credit even though Tesla isn’t on the “eligible vehicles” list yet. Let me know if you have any questions."
This one might have the performance motors. There’s an aftermarket ghost mod you can buy to unlock it.
It looks good! My Model 3 2018 long-range has about 115000 miles. What does your 100% range show on the battery thing?
Nice! It’s amazing how much you can benefit from someone’s “warranty anxiety” lol.
"Those first gen wheels are so much better than the current ones. The thick border they added just looks bad. I like the uberturbines more, but the 19’s were great in the beginning."
Wow 121k. It’s at its end of life. Of wait. That’s for gas cars. Tesla goes to 400k miles!
Honestly dude this feels like a score especially if you can get the tax credit. Congrats
"What a beaut! who would think you could get AWD for that price (especially 3-4 months ago), if you get the tax credit it is almost like free when you consider the gas you save. Wonder how much longer the battery will last?"
Brave man
Looks as clean as my 2020. Nice price.
how good is the range after 121k miles?
"I think its a good bet. Looks like in nice condition. Good way to enjoy tesla, potentially for a long time without breaking the bank. I have 2018 70k miles I plan to take to 150k miles at least. Fingers crossed."
"$21,000. $4000 less with federal used EV rebate!"
Good job hoovie what does the wizzard say?
"I bought 2 weeks ago 2018 long range, premium Whees and connectivity, EAP, 109k miles 24,999"
That thing is beautiful! Congrats and keep us up on the high-mileage woes as you go.
"If it was actually $25k or less, does it qualify for the used EV tax credit?!"
Personally I would never put 25k towards a car with 121k miles.
"I have the same yr, LR AWD, and in red. 51K miles. Hope you love it! FYI if you buy any aftermarket stuff that hooks to the canbus, you have Variant A, the first variant. Wire harness, etc. changes at the variant level.."
I got a 2018 model 3 performance with 50k miles for about $36ish k
Give it 4 years and the maintenance could cause it to be the most expensive car in the USA haha
Im impressed it held value so well given what Tesla offers on trade for cars with fewer miles and three years newer.
I believe you think you won but not with those kind of miles I would pay a few extra thousand dollars and get 30k miles lol rather than 121
"Just out of warranty on the battery, nice."
That’s an insane price to pay for a car with no warranty whatsoever. Your battery could die tomorrow and you’d be out another $20k
I saw one for $15k the other day
I would’ve sold you my RWD 2021 for 25k. It has 122k miles
"I’d be really cautious if I were you. That’s about the mileage things really started to get weird on mine. Being an early vehicle, QC “under the hood” was even worse than it is now. You did overpay for it (by probably 8k?), but as long as you’re gentle with it, it might be okay. Specifically, I would be careful with potholes, jackrabbit starts, and letting the battery hit 0. Get the brakes pulled apart and lubricated annually to help prevent them from binding (they probably still have 0 wear just like mine). It might also be smart to go into service mode and see if any silent warnings are accumulated."
Why?
Not the cheapest....
shit 121K miles is a lot!
to all commenters would you agree plus 3-4k on 2019 and 2020 and 2021 and such same mileage?
"Looks beautiful, time to start having fun."
Great job! I beautiful color. Im hoping that this kind of option will be more and more available.
For 121k that looks mint. Someone really loved that car
"I’ve been watching the higher mileage example ones ones to see if the price drops have had any effect on the prices. I don’t qualify for the tax credit, but idk if I’d ever spend $45k for a car, so these look really good! I def would not mind paying the price you did for a higher mileage one in good condition."
Congrats !
Thats amazing...Im surprised it was a LR AWD for that price.
Those chrome handles are nice.
Whats the estimated range at 100%?

I wish my 2023 Tesla model 3 would do this already I need Tesla vision
"Before the comments go nuts, read up if you’re not in the know:  Which translates to < 1% error rate vs between 1% - 3% error rate for uss. Better yet, accuracy can be improved with a software update if a better model is developed or an edge case is found"
"It’s actually a bit amusing looking at everyone debating the relative accuracy and advantages/disadvantages of USS vs cameras for near distance detection. Now I could be way off base here, but if you’re trying for ultimate accuracy & reliability, wouldn’t using BOTH in combination be the truly superior option? 🤷🏻‍♂️"
I mean cool and all but I wouldn’t trust it like I do the USS.
"Armchair engineer here. The major flaw with ultrasonic sensors is that when more and more cars with this technology get on the road, you get more and more interference which results in noisier data. Bad data in, bad data out. Using purely tesla vision with cameras, youre able bypass this issue and scale as far as you want without interference."
"Did someone say a camera would have a less error rate than a sensor. Baloney. I’m a 30 year naval marine engineer. There doesn’t exist a camera on earth that could beat out a ultrasonic, electromagnetic or frequency modulated or doplar type sensors or radios. Let’s be honest here. Tesla moved to cameras because of a shortage. That’s it. Not because it’s better. It’s worse. Period."
"I thought the vision only model s/x already did this? At least my 2022 model s already display distance while trying to park. Though its not accurate at all. The actual distance is pretty off, especially the front distance calculation. I have hit my washing machine one time going forward because the car shows that I got plenty of space in front."
"The only thing I learned from reading these comments is that it doesn’t seem like anyone can agree which system works “better”. Honestly it all feels a bit childish. You can argue about ultrasonics and parallax all you want. Give me some science to prove your point, tell me the error and success rate of each type and then I’ll be convinced that one is better than another. Until then you’re all just bickering to prove that you bought the “right” model and the other Tesla models are less superior to your own 🤷‍♂️"
is there some A/B testing going on or does the person just have a rare software version?
What happens in a parking lot after you park and the cars around you change and the new cars park closer? Does it present false data?
"Makes sense especially with multiple cameras, should be able to work out distances of things... even one camera might be able to do it."
"Can we get a compilation of teslas crashing into stationary object on a sunny freeway, or teslas crashing into stuff when they get called on command? My dog also knows his name and also comes to it sometimes. He also loves to come crashing into stuff while he does it, I shouldve named him Tesla"
FLIR: take the guessing out of the game.
I can’t wait until mine can do this…
All Australian Teslas still come with USS.
Ultrasonic and radar gets really messy when everyone uses it.
I think the MX Plaid will sell better than the MS Plaid. The wealthy like to be chauffeured in China.
Still waiting for my Plaid—ordered 21 months ago
need wait for end of the year for new sales😉 hopefully even more discounts than in 22
We’re still waiting for new model s/x in the Uk. Price disappeared online about a year ago. I guess they’re waiting to fill backlog before accepting new orders.
Only $2k savings for a reduction of 15% of range is not worth it IMO. The difference needs to be closer to 4-5k to make this worthwhile.
Why would anyone buy this for such a small price difference to the LR?
[deleted]
"I guess the new batteries (4680) are cheaper, not better? I suppose this has been known, that the energy density isnt that great, but still"
And its gone...according to my ZIP search as OP did not give link
for that price you could have bought an intel mac pro with 1.5TB of RAM
Needs to be 4-5k cheaper than LR model Y. I own 2021 MYP 100% shows 280miles. With 4680 real range will be crap knowing how teslas range is overly optimistic
Whats bizarre is these 4680s are not LFP right. You cannot safely charge them to 100 percent every night. They will degrade at the same rate more or less as the LR cells but have less starting capacity.
Anyone know if the 4680 battery is more reliable or the battery degradation is less than the 2170 type?
This model is priced to make the LR look like a better deal. Its not priced to actually move volumes
They should make this 4680 battery version RWD and ship it for ~$45k.
"Isn’t the 4680 ones have front and rear casting, seat mounting to battery, less rattling and better handling?"
"If they made this RWD, it would be cheaper and get more range, maybe 290 miles. They could price it at $48,000 and people could get it for $40,500 with the tax credit. Since they cant make too much 4680 supply, it would control canibalization of the LR model."
Model Y 4680 battery: $183 per mile of range. Model Y Long Range: $161 per mile of range The Long Range is a much better deal.
Not sure why some are so fascinated with being an early adopter on an inferior battery pack.
"Whats happened with the 4680? Wasnt Tesla supposed to be at like 100GWh production by now? Seems like they still arent at high volume production, but havent heard any updates, even though these new batteries were supposed to be a pretty critical part of Teslas future."
Is this dual motor or no?
"Damn I wish they were that cheap here (melb, Australia)"
"This upsets the living hell out of me… I spent 6 months ago 54,000 in a model 3 LR, I would have gotten this🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️"
"Not sure if it is better than the long range version , do you guys see any other advantages besides the $2K savings?"
How can you tell is a 4680 battery?
[deleted]
How do you know its 4680?
[deleted]
"I think this is worth the 2k price drop personally. The convenience of super charging is still not great, and the ideal range on an EV would be around 400 miles to guarantee atleast 300+ real world miles consistently. The road trip I took in my model Y LR made me really second guess EVs, and plug in hybrids are the best of both worlds in my opinion. You can road trip without waiting 45-60 minutes to charge, and in most cases, you aren’t spending that much more depending on your fuel efficiency. I’d argue the convenience is worth the extra $10 I pay at the pump currently."
"Thats the same range i am getting from my 22 model y perf. We drive it everyday commuting and leisure. We do charge at home though. I would get it if i was in the market. Still same range as the competitors. But yes, good point… price is very close to the LR."
Do these have matrix?
How do we know it’s 4680? I’ve seen it mentioned elsewhere but I’ve missed the memo
Are these the “million mile battery?”
Does this model have acceleration boost?
Where are the 70k Y folks?
Anyone comment on which headlights these come with?
Welp it looks like theyre sold out of em already.
"Why does one call this 4680 instead of what it is, Standard or Short Range (relative to the Long Range). The shape of your battery doesn’t make it better with less capacity."
Is it possible that Tesla will Update the battery (OTA) to let say 300+ later??
*Cries in Canadian dollars*
"Only until March? Darn, I was planning on taking all year to find a buyer for my old one."
This is the long range? Does Tesla only sell the long range in the USA?
LFP 4680 would be a no-brainer choice for me over LR. Not NMC 4680.
Is there a reason Im not seeing this as an option when I got on the web page? Im in the US...
How do you know it’s 4680?
Are these models using the new mega casting? That might be a big advantage over the long range no? Seems like NVH would be minimized some? Or am I misunderstanding what that was about the whole structural pack design? Like its in the body of the car now…..
How is it that in Illinois it’s still showing $54k for the basic MY LR?
Can someone please explain why the tax credit is only good through March?
Could anyone tell me if software changes would enable to hardware to have increased mileage/performance in the future. Or is is a physical limitation
The biggest benefit would be to get $7500 ev credit. Custom orders won’t be delivered till May/ June and you won’t get the full credit post march. Only 4680 model y were in stock. $51.5k vs 54.9k is $3.5k in savings. Plus another 3.5k extra ev credit brings it to $7k reduction which is significantly less. Most people don’t need to use 330 mile range daily and would be okay for them IMO.
Stock still struggling today.
They gonna run out of rich people (with Darwin awards) and sales are gonna tank.
"> In addition, ICE cars have very complex transmissions (replacement cost ~$5000). Toyota hybrid transmissions dont fail."
"When Tesla has been called out by Clean Technica, a fan site, you know it is quite bad."
"Some cheap ass tires at 30,000 and 60,000 mi. Just sayin."
Averaging right at 6 cents a mile in maintenance. Looks like all the extra money saved on oil changes went to tires and alignments.
Shouldn’t have cheaped out on the first two sets of tires.
"Of course. The ""EV barely needs maintenance"" saying is ridiculous, they just need different type of care. And EVs arent really ""simpler"" because they have less moving parts, its just a different type of complexity. I mean turbine engines are incredibly complex and they only have 1 moving part."
Half of the cost has been in tires because the author cheaped out on them the first two times...
">which EVs do not have, radiator/cooling systems, etc., etc., etc. Who wants to tell him?"
"Those fiberboard under-shields will be a continual failure and cost. I would either leave them off or cut something better like ABS plastic sheet to redesign them. They only serve to slightly reduce air drag. The $74 to ""reseal upper ball joint"" meant squirting a glob of RTV over the ball joint. Better to buy the aftermarket Meyle upper control arms to permanently fix that poor design. Why so many wheel alignments? Due to worn ball joints (squeaks) and bushings? Was the ""bushing support holes"" being buggered up, the two bolts which unscrew in many 3/Y to damage the tapped holes? You will always pay thru the nose for repairs on a newish car. If economical transportation is more your goal than posing, a 10+ year old common vehicle will have cheap and easy parts. Ive paid $25 for a rebuilt driveshaft for my old minivan and $10 for a new rotor. Compare to $3500 each for new matrix LED headlamp for a current Audi. If you buy a new status car, be careful not to drop the soap at the dealership shop."
"How much does it cost to replace the battery pack for any Tesla vehicle? Current cost of Model 3 battery may cost over $13,500. You can expect the labor charge to be around $2,300. So, the total cost of battery replacement may range around $15,800... according to google. Thats more than a transmission and engine replacement for a Camry."
"Since we’re sharing our one-off personal experiences. 2019 M3 LR RWD with 83,036 miles as of posting. 1) 12v battery at 51k mobile repair while I was at work for $110 2) Reseal upper ball arms at 64k. This was a recall fix they did while I had mobile repair for something unrelated (see next). I had zero issues and this cost $0 or time as I was at work with mobile repair. 3) replace window washing fluid hose that stopped supplying water at 64k miles. Mobile repair while I was at work $90. 4) replaced window visor clip mobile repair $10 at 79k. I could’ve done this myself for a few bucks and have done so on other cars but was lazy and this was easy. 5) Had general maint to check quality of brake fluid at 81k for $20 with mobile repair while at work. Learned how to do this myself in future with test strips. 6) Elective cost not required. I decided to upgrade from HW 2.5 to 3.0 after buying 2022 MYP and seeing how much better the visuals and camera clarity was. This cost me $1000 for the upgrade and the $560 to replace my cabin interior camera which was faulty and now needed to be used (part of safety mech to verify I’m watching road). This was serviced at center. Non-Tesla service items 1) 4x replaced cabin air filter so far. Buy off Amazon or Tesla site for avg $15. Takes about 15min to replace. Total cost $60. 2) 1 set of tires at 50k from Discount Tires for $1100. Michelin Primacy MXM4 3) Average $30/mo in fuel before Covid charging 100% at home ($0.06/kWh) driving about 80miles 6/days a week. Previous car (2015 ford fusion hybrid 40mpg) was costing me about $120/mo. My total fuel cost on M3 in 2022 was $315 on 12k miles driven. Over 4 years of ownership I’ve saved at least $3,500 estimating 40mpg at $3.50/gallon gas over 65,000 miles (removed the mileage for long trips as I used SC and costs there are closer to gas pump - still less) 4) Fusion needs oil, filter and lube maintenance every 10k miles. I only use full synthetic which costs me an average of $80 (low was $70 and current costs are at $100 over last couple years). For 80k miles, this would have cost me $640. My total out of pocket has been about $4,700 rounding up. Less my savings from fuel and maintenance of $4,100 (round down) leaves me with a net spent of $600 so far. Plus in AZ I’ve had free HOV lane access and 5yrs of registration only cost me $250 vs any other $50k car would have been $500 a year or more. (My 2022 MYP was $300 for 1 yr which is still a reduced rate) Edit : forgot to add my fuel costs into out of pocket. Updated"
Almost $1000 on front and rear aero shields? This person didn’t even try to do anything themself.
"Are 4 wheel alignments needed annually? Ive done one when I picked up the car back in December 2021 as it was delivered with a crooked steering wheel. It was not covered under warranty since I didnt bring it in within 10 days. I rotate the tires every 5-6000 miles and its been 17 months and 19,000 miles and Im still on the original tires. I think another 5000 miles and Ill be replacing them though. Is another 4-wheel alignment necessary?"
"$5.5k maintenance for a $50k car (that is known to have soddy build quality) after 90k miles isn’t bad. You’re expected to pay almost twice as much on annual maintenance on a non-Japanese luxury vehicle at the same price and your savings on gas alone should offset that cost. But general rule of thumb is: expect “luxury” maintenance cost for a vehicle priced in the luxury range. You don’t buy a $50k vehicle and expect it to be maintenance free (nor should you complain about it, imo)."
"Buys cheap tires then goes all shocked Pikachu when they dont last. Includes damage she admits she caused *TWICE* in ""maintenance"" costs. And the rest of her ""costs"" are things that have been fixed or eliminated in current cars (heat pump and suspension)."
"2016 Honda HRV 6-Speed manual 140,000 (tires + recalled ignition starter switch)"
"40k miles for tires is not great, but not absurdly bad either. Most of the rest of this looks like poor driving habits, and potential defects with the car itself."
"Any random car could have higher than average maintenance costs Tire life is very variable depending on what tire, how you drive and if you keep them properly inflated Tires and 12V battery have been the only cost to maintain my M3 and pleased I spend more on tires than “fuel”"
"6 cents maintenance cost per mile is right on average for BEVs, according to the following study:  Compared to 9 cents/mile for PHEVs, and 10 cents/mile for ICE."
"Based on the control arm repairs, alignments, and tire replacements… this Tesla might have a bad suspension."
"Its unfair to include the 2 aero shields (at $427 each, installed) in ""maintenance"" since these were replaced because of what is essentially collision damage. Additionally three alignments seems excessive. I wonder if the tire sales folks talked her into those? But including those in the total cost makes for a better story, so I get it."
get a ruler and measure! damage over 3 inches long is eligible to file a claim with Turo
"The vaaaaaast majority of people who drive cars don’t give a shit about curb rash. Take photos, submit the claim, get it repaired."
This one is decent file for repair they will pay 150$
Destroyed? Bit prone to hyperbole are we...
Yes submit a claim I’ve gotten to the point where I tell e every guest to watch out for curb rashes and I also tell them how much it’ll be to get repairs and last thing I’ll write them a message telling them to take pre trip photos of each wheel
"I would submit it 100%, Ive had a rim damaged and from the exterior it looked ok but the inside was bent and would pop the tire over time. Better safe then sorry."
"Ouch, Id be upset for sure, especially since mine are pristine thanks to my warranty lol Does turo have a policy for this?"
Im shocked at all the terrible drivers and stories this sub provides
"I usually try to work with the guest. They’ve been nice and offered to fix it themselves in the past. If not, get it fixed at a cheap place and send them the invoice. If they refuse to pay, file a claim. I agree this curb hit is a bit much"
"""destroyed"" lol This is like the other post with the host saying the guest crashed the car and it had some scratches on the bumper"
"Heh, not worth sweating my friend, I rarely go after these because of my deductible. But sometimes its worth just filing the claim, submitting the pics, and seeing if the guest will work with you offline. A lot of times guests are savvy and just ghost you because they know you have a deductible and no real recourse. But every once in a while, you get a good citizen to throw you some cash. If you get so lucky, pocket it and save it for when you need to completely replace the wheel. Because youre gonna get these bad boys scraped up even worse than this over the summer. Welcome to the gang."
Part of doing business
"I rented a Tesla last month and it too had curb rash. Admittedly, the visibility is horrendous so I cant say Im surprised."
"Ask them to pay with cash. If you file a claim both of you get hit out of pocket cuz of deductibles. Call around. I know of a place that does rim repairs for Tesla for $25-50 bucks. Sometimes they do promotions to get customers. Lastly if you get a good quote, charge them reasonably if theyre paying out of pocket. Charge for the rim damage and some inconvenience fee/labor fee."
"depends on where you are but that kind of rash is 100-$150ish in my market. if you have good before pics and take a pic with a ruler, looks like over 3 inches, they should pay you out for it."
That’s regular wear and tear
The only time I hear about George Soros is when right wingers talk about him.
Literally nobody in the left cares about Soros
I fully assume Elon is watching InfoWars at this point and this meme backs that up. All thats missing is the blood libel and wrongly accusing Soros of being a Nazi.
"Hey, Elon, what do *you* think *this* meme *you* posted actually ***means***? What is your message? And please, use your words, Elon. e.g. Are you saying that even those of us who dont like billionaires such as yourself are in truth actually people who say we dont like billionaires but will nevertheless happily suck on the exact same boot of the billionaire upper class if the exact same boot is decorated/disguised/labelled to suit our specific boot-sucking taste? Are you the real Soros? Is the boot actually yours but youve made it look like Soros boot to make people suck on it? Are you saying theres some other oppressive force/boot with your name on it, and then your name is replaced on the boot by ""Soros ""and the cartoon anti-billionaire character either gladly sucks on the boot or is kicked in the mush by the billionaire boot... i.e. In other words, are you saying that you believe that you billionaires have a beyond perverse level and amount of wealth and influence over humanity as a whole and need to have your... legs and power broken, and/or... What? What the fuck are you actually getting at?"
Musk is a 51 year old trying to be hip and cool with people that have an average IQ of 50.
"So, we are about a week away from Elon posting swastikas with the caption ""lulz."""
"Genuine question: do fucking *any* left wing people whatsoever even know who SOROS is? Let alone care? Because, as a filthy leftwing hippie commie bastard, the only people Ive EVER seen talk about this guy are right wing conservatives, so I think theres at least some projection going on here? And before you ask, no, I definitely wasnt paid to post this, that would be nice though if this SOROS guy wants to reach out or something lol"
He ended up deleting the tweet. I wonder why?
Why do these people think anyone to the left of Barack Obama loves George Soros? I literally go months without remembering his existence.
"“Oh you guys don’t like the billionaire who lobbied governments to not spend money on public services & instead got them to give him billions to make a shitty tunnel, tries to crush unions & workers rights, runs businesses into the ground through incompetence, encourages fascism on twitter & makes a fool of himself everyday but you like the billionaire Jew philanthropist who was forced to work for the Nazis as a child & promotes liberalism? Hypocrites!”"
I need to constantly remind myself that this man is in his early 50s
But isnt that what his fanboys are doing to him?
"I saw that and was instinctively about to reply with ""Antisemitism. Antisemitism is what’s happening here”. but bailed when I instinctively realized that itd be buried under thousands of tweets about how ""the Left loves billionaire commie Jews"" that were already there. That ol’ “judeo-bolshevism” BS circa 1938 Germany is never going to go away when the childish dork who owns the town square for the world’s shakers & movers to be heard has surrounded himself with its relentless purveyors & he wants to be “cool” like them. What a circus porta-potty of a timeline this is. At least the few sane people I saw on there tonight had the same reaction."
Ok who the FUCK is Soros?
Intelligence is knowing Elon is a douche Wisdom is knowing he doesn’t care about anyone but himself
So he admits he’s a simp that weirdly wants his feet sucked? But so is George Soros?
Heyheyhey! Lay off Uncle Soros! My 22 room mansion doesnt pay for itself! Especially since I only have 1 bathroom in it. Do you know how it feels to need to run 5 minutes in your own home to use the shitter? /s
"""Youre right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is."" -Musk Musk loves participating in no-win situations."
"When right wingers mention Soros its a dog whistle for ""the Jews"""
When did anybody simp for Soros?
Ive been left leaning my entire life. The right always talks about how much I love Soros. I honestly have no idea who tf that is. Why do republicans want me to love him so much?
this guys need for adulation is just pathetic; what a pathological dork he is
Soros=Emmanuel Goldstein
The true response of 99% of people when you mention Soros: “…who?”
"Electric car salesman alienates the only people who would ever buy an electric car, more at 11"
"NO Way. the richest man in the world is a ""VICTIM OF LEFTIST OPRESSION"""
I’m pretty sure the only people who gives a shit about Soros are hardcore right-wingers and Elon as Soros is a big investor into his companies but don’t let the right-wingers know that lol
I feel like if you swapped the names its way more accurate haha.
"Yes, it’s true, all us ultra-extreme revolutionary communists alway talk about what a joy it would be lick the bum hole of Soros"
Why would you want to suck any boot with a name on it?
"Yup, Soros is awesome. Holocaust survivor, not allowed to attend school in Nazi Germany, goes on to get Masters in philosophy, makes a fortune and devotes it to spreading the ideas of liberal democracy, helps bring about the end of the Soviet Union, opposes dictatorships everywhere, still making changes in the world in his nineties. Soros really shows Elon for the piece of shit he is."
I couldn’t point Soros out in a picture. I have no idea what he looks like or even what he owns or does. The only people who focus on Soros are right wing nut jobs like Elon Musk.
“Leftists *looove* soros. Want proof? Just look at this comic I made”
Does he really think people worship soros? What a prick
"A better comic would show all the billionaires who are typically mildly concerned about public image, laid back in a zen state because some asshat new-money went full rodeo clown for no apparent reason."
Who the actual fuck is soros?
Nice to see Elon splitting his time between 4chan and Twitter. A balanced media diet.
He changed it because at this rate Elon won’t be a Billionaire by Thanksgiving
"Nobody cares about Soros except 1. If they are talking specifically about what a powerful market mover hes been in the past, e.g. Black Wednesday in the UK, but literally nobody likes him for this except perhaps his heirs. Like with Musk, I blame the voter for a government that maintains a system that allows his behaviour, and so do most people because - well - Thatcherism/Reaganism is irrational and immoral. 2. If they dont really know much about him except vague ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((facts about his heritage)))))))))))))))))))))))))))) which are irrelevant unless you fantasise about having enough money to kit yourself out in vintage Hugo Boss threads and take the phrase ""behold the master race"" without irony. Its kind of funny to watch the far right pit this epic battle between liberal democratic billionaires and authoritarian conservative billionaires, while anyone remotely left leaning has never pretended not to hate them all already. Its like they cant comprehend a mindset that doesnt involve sticking at least one powerful mans dick in your mouth every day. Its not that anyone likes Soros, Eloon, its that hes not the headlining clown at the circus giving us so much free entertainment while by showing the world he has no clothes and has just been a grifter all along."
"It’s great cause cons, alt right, general republicans, etc. all say so much conspiracy nonsense about George Soros that I don’t think I’ve ever personally heard anyone say a single positive thing about him"
 Fixed it
"Soros is Jewish and Rich, already he is a boogy man for the insane right which are completely ruled by nazis agendas now. Add to the he grew up under the nazis when he was a boy and generally hates authoritarian governments and thus has actually tried to combat such governments by supporting free journalism, democracy, etc world wide. It means he is of course going to be attacked by all the right wing channels taking money from far right authoritarian elites like the Russians oligarchs, the Koch(Only Single Brother now) and the rest of the rich billionaire criminals of the world who try to undermine true freedom etc world wide. Elon is coming from a deeply messed up family life you have to believe that he definitely didn’t come out of that without some very messed up beliefs about the world."
This is the same guy who said he’s not a conservative 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Only the right cares about Soros and I’ve never heard him spoken about otherwise
Nobody ever talks about Soros except conservatives lol
I have never met anyone who doesnt watch fox news that even mentions Soros in any way
"Forcing his enemies to lick his Soros boots seems to have a ""dominate the peasants"" vibe to it"
“Enough musk spam “ Proceeds to repost every single tweet he makes and put up headshots of how much y’all “dislike” him Fr I am out of this sub. Just rename it /r/MuskSpam
"Shrug... honestly this is pretty funny, both the meme and his caption. I he could just stick to this stuff hed be a million times less irritating."
ORBAN HAS ACCESS TO ELONS ACCOUNT!
Im somewhat convinced that many idiots who complain about Soros think that when feminists talk about sorority theyre alluding to him.
What a fucking 12 year old
No one cares about Soros except for Musk
I have never heard that man even speak. Wouldn’t know he exists if not for nut jobs like Musk.
"How long will it take for Musk pick a jewish ancestral of 153637162 years ago and use them as a free pass to do those ""controversial"" jokes?"
"My leftist buddies don’t think much of George Soros. I guess they merely dislike him, which is better than how they feel about Musk, I guess."
Since when did Teslas start coming with Frame-Shift Drives?
"Its all the fault of antifa, this clearly centralized institution that wants our daughters to changer their sex into Latinx. If only Bakunin, Kropotkin and proudhon hadnt cowritten The open society and its enemies back in the Nazi Soviet Russia. Then Stalin wouldnt have read it and create the feds. The day everyone has heard 1000 more times about Orwells 1984 this will all be solved, luckily. Glory to Musk for liberating us."
Who the fuck is George soros
Just realized that most likely Elon pays a group of engineers with h-1b visa to create memes all day.
"Fuck George Soros too. I don’t like him either, and frankly the only time I think about Soros is when the tinfoil hat brigade reminds me he exists."
"Totally, lots of ordinary people know who Soros is and worship him."
Literally never heard anyone bring up soros but conservatives.
Who?
Never heard that guy in my life
this guy is legit a fucking idiot
"The Soros trope is a well-worn antisemitic dog whistle. Its only a matter of time until Elon comes out saying ""I love Hitler""."
"Ive heard about George Soros from right wingers so much, but I still dont know who the fuck that guy is."
Not a single antifa member likes Sorros. To them sorrow is just another rich pos. They just dont believe in the conspiracies about him.
Is Elon saying he’s funded by George Soros? 🙃
So Musk is now going down the anti-Semitism rabbit hole now.
"Yes, Elon. Tell us all how the Jews are to blame."
Elon is trying so hard lmao
I wouldn’t know who George Soros was if Republicans didn’t scream about him so much. It’s hard to bootlick someone who isn’t an attention whore. Tax Soros. We wouldn’t need —don’t even know if he’s paying our crisis actors (joke)—his philanthropy if obscenely wealthy people were taxed appropriately and things outside of the military were funded.
He admits he is an iron boot.
"Allow me to translate. Elon Musk: ""Leftists claim to hate billionaires, and yet they dont want to murder Jews, who control the world"""
Is that it?
"This is that Twitter trope where you make up a person in your head, and dunk on them. Straw manning in illustrative format."
"So, Musk thinks he and Soros are pretty much the same because they’re both billionaires. Not surprising. Fun fact, that will probably play right into the hands of the conspiracy nuts: Soros’ first language was Esperanto."
"Soros is just the Hungarian version of Warren Buffett except hes minimally prosocial. Since hes Jewish, this minimal prosociality makes him a target for all kinds of nutjob crazy. But whatever, hes a billionaire, and billionaires are bad. Hes just far down the list of badness, is all, and IDK, if Im trying to do something prosocial and Soros wants to give me some money, fuggit, Ill take his money."
"Its funny because its pure projection and the exact reverse of it is true. Leftists dont like Soros for many of the same reasons they dont like Musk, so it is purely consistent and there is no hypocrisy. Its the right wingers who hate Soros but love Musk. And the hate Soros because he is Jewish and sometimes donates to progressive causes but they think he secretly controls the government and all major media outlets except Fox News."
"I don’t know a single person who likes Soros, but I know a few incels who love Elon"

I just joined this demographic of people. Switching from a 2002 Camry to a Model 3 with the late December deal. People who love sedans are still out there looking for another one. Tesla model 3 remains the most competitive in the sub 50K-60K department for electric sedans.
It’s crazy how polarized people are on Tesla. There seems to be no middle ground. Either people think it’s a sham and Elon is the devil or Tesla is manna from the gods. Can’t we just be pumped that a 4th American car company is succeeding and providing more options to consumers either directly through Tesla products or indirectly through pressure for other car company’s to go electric?
I love my 2022 m3. I might buy a X in a couple of yrs. Driving it never gets old
Love my model 3. Seriously is the best car!
No demand.
So many tesla around lately
I have been seeing a lot more on the roads
"I purchased 3 years ago... switched from a Camry. I did a lifetime cost comparison between the Camry I would have otherwise purchased as a replacement, and the Long Range Model 3, and found that the cost difference between fuel alone made up the difference between the cost of the two vehicles... Of course, insurance and personal property tax suck more on the Tesla, but it should also hopefully have a bit less maintenance over its life."
Big Brain : Dont need to buy a new Camry because the old one never died
Is there such thing as small or big size sedans? What are some example of some of there are?
Thats very impressive!
BUT GM AND FORD /s
Love Tesla. Great to see em doing so well!
"I don’t know how it is in other states or countries. But I’m Hawaii, the only licensee of Toyota, Servco has a huge monopoly here. Not only for Toyota/Lexus but they somehow have a deal with HPD. You see HPD guys in Camrys and 4Runners all day long."
How is this possible? I thought I heard from Dave Jones of EEVBlog that Teslas had a massive import tax on them in Australia that somehow other cars did not? Perhaps I misremember or misunderstood.
America 🇺🇸 fuck yeah
cheese and rice Tezluh way to go
The Model 3 counts as a midsize sedan? Its smaller than a Jetta...
Cant wait to see the used car market in 10-15 years. All Teslas will be long dead and normal used cars will be popping in prices
Good on you Elon!
Isn’t camry larger than model 3?
"Is the model 3 cheaper in Australia? In US bucks, theres like $14,000 difference in MSRP. Or about the equivalent of 20,000 AUD."
"From my understanding, its due to the weight of the vehicle not meeting the IRS threshold for an SUV by like 200 pounds or something and the 7 seater meets it due to the extra weight. I suspect Tesla will find a way around this. Edit: I was mistaken, the real reason it doesn’t qualify is the ride height is 1.1” too low."
"The Model Y AWD used to be 49,990 and should go back to the MSRP anyway."
"Tesla will “probably” just offer their own 7500 credit instead of the dropping the price to under 55k, and some ppl probably prefer up front 7500 off vs waiting till tax season"
Its time for tesla to drop the prices back to its original MSRP
"From the article: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has published a list of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles that are eligible for federal tax credits under the new Inflation Reduction Act. Valid for purchases made on or after January 1, 2023, the list includes several Tesla models, as the new law has eliminated the tax credit cap for automakers that hit 200,000 electric vehicles sold. It does not include all Tesla models, though. Since theres an applicable MSRP limit of $55,000 for electric cars and $80,000 MSRP limit for electric SUVs, trucks and vans, the Tesla Model S sedan and Model X SUV are not eligible for the $7,500 tax credit. Thats because the Model S starts at around $105,000 and the Model X is priced from approximately $121,000. While that was expected, the fact that other Tesla models are overlooked comes as a surprise for many. If you look at the list of Tesla vehicles released by the IRS (see it at the bottom of this page), youll notice that not all Model Y vehicles are classified as SUVs."
Damn. All those people going to be mad when they pushed out their deliveries.
"Announce a new MY long-ish range trim with software locked 200mi range and 8 sec 0-60 for 54k. 10k to unlock, hardware is identical to MYLR."
"The whole problem is the IRS and their continued use of this nonsensical 6000lb GVWR rule that the IRS uses to determine if something is a ""truck or SUV"". This is the core of the issue. Youll notice the VM ID4 has a couple of trims that qualify as SUVs and the other trims qualify as cars and the trims are physically identical, its just the added features push the GVWR over the limit. The entire methodology is nonsense. All it will do is force manufacturers to change the stated GVWR for 2024 to be greater than 6000lbs whether it is or not. So Tesla will need to build a special Model Y for 2023 that is cheap and then they can retire it in 2024 when they are able to get the GVWR for the 5 seater up to 6000lbs."
I actually think this is good news. Tesla has plenty of room in their gross profit % to lower prices to $55k. Remember a year and a half ago the model Y LR was under $55k
"EDIT: It turns out the weight is not the issue. [Why do only certain trims of the Ford Mach-E, Tesla Model Y and ID4 qualify as SUVs for the IRA tax credit while others don’t?]( I believe that the 5-seat Model Y is excluded because the IRS stipulated years ago that a vehicle has to weigh over 6,000lbs to be classified as an SUV. I’m interested to know why *nobody* seemed to anticipate this. On Twitter, Elon said that it was “messed up”, suggesting that he wasn’t aware, so presumably nobody at Tesla was aware either. - Elon didn’t know? - Tesla didn’t know? - The Tesla/EV stock analysts didn’t know? - The Tesla/EV social media influencers didn’t know? - The mainstream media didn’t know? Really? How did this happen?"
I am not even American so have no skin in this game. But model-Y is not an SUV. Its model-3 in a different shape. Teslas profit margin per car is also \*huge\*. It makes 8x per car than Toyota. Theres a lot of room for them to come under the price threshold.
"This is an excellent explanation: [Why do only certain trims of the Ford Mach-E, Tesla Model Y and ID4 qualify as SUVs for the IRA tax credit while others don’t?]("
Elon should consider it tho. It would sell like water in a desert at $55k.
Why is this fuckass government additionally subsidizing SUVs?
Time to add some ballast. Just fill up the sub trunk with some water and then have an optional ‘drain’ once to take delivery haha
I would love to see a MY Performance with 7 seats…
"Lower the price, problem solved!"
Model Y is more hatchback than SUV. It’s closer to a Matrix than a suburban.
Thread on how it could qualify 
Glad I took delivery in 2022 then. Whew. No more fomo.
This is just completely idiotic
Can we tell nyc parking garages? They always charge extra bc they consider it an suv.
Because it’s not an SUV. It’s a hatchback. Sick of these car companies trying to pretend their little cars are SUVs.
Its wildly overpriced. Tesla should lower the price. Problem solved
Ive always said it was a hatchback ;)
Never buy until last fews days of the year.
Lol….. all those people canceling their Y after nearly a year wait.. 🤦🏻‍♂️
It appears they had to jump through a few hoops to ensure the Model Y didnt qualify. The YouTube channel Matt Pocius went through the legislation and concluded that if the Model Y raised its suspension 20cm and lost 2% of range then they would be able to qualify. Phillip.
It’s an SUV in name only. About as much sport utility vehicle as a Kia Soul with less ground clearance.
"Tesla should introduce a RWD model y for $54,999. They are charging below that in Europe for those RWD models. This is a great opportunity to accelerate sales. If they can use 4680 cells with domestic lithium the subsidy should hold past March/April. Getting a MY below 50k after incentive would create multi month wait times."
Unpopular opinion: if you can afford a model Y you don’t qualify anyway due to the salary cap.
It looks like the government has a beef with Tesla or Musk and is bending over backwards to exclude as many Tesla vehicles from the discounts as possible.
This is a direct attack on the model Y by traditional automakers.
"Yet the five seat Ford Escape plug in hybrid qualifies for an up to $80,000 MSRP???"
Never buy a Tesla until last 5 days of the year.
"Tesla, you know what to do. 5 seat Model Y -$55k msrp."
"Apparently Tesla is working on getting this figured out, according to one of their salespeople."
"Federal ""EV credit"" is a fucking scam. Its a preemptive bailout for legacy auto so they can sell the same gasoline shitbox, only now with a pathetically tiny traction battery."
Biden administration playing politics instead of applying objective criteria. Shameful.
September 2022 owners continue to get fucked
"Just offer a third row of basic, no frills, jump seats. Then the third row rule is met. (Thought experiment: starting at the lowest new Model S price point, if the third row option was still available, would have been under the $80k SUV limit. Seems some legacy Model S cars might identify as SUVs in an alternate universe, had the current incentive existed at the same time as those configurations?)"
"Man, the government really doesnt know how to get out of their own way do they?"
"Regardless of the why the IRS would have found a way to exclude it.. If its due to the ride height Tesla might just put on bigger tires and a mild lift. I prefer the 18"" wheels and some Wildpeak tires myself."
EPA model Y is SUV but IRS Model Y is not-EPA & IRS are located in different continents![img](emote|t5_2s3j5|17555)
Just needs a lift to qualify. Was thinking the model Y could benefit from a lifted version or one with air suspension that could raise itself anyways. Little bit of plastic cladding and weve got an off-road trim
"Yeah this is going to hurt Tesla, bigly!"
"Well, I suppose Tesla should lower the price and it will benefit everyone. Government isn’t doing this to allow companies to inflate and subsidize/boost profits… it’s to stimulate demand and transition from fossil fuels. Corporate partnership in this would be helpful."
SUV > Crossover
7 seater bitches. Should have read the reg before you bought. We did. It was in the IRS pre-publication bulletin. Toilet reading suckers.
F150 Lightning is a better vehicle anyway
"Fuk this. I’m going to qualify it, audit me if you want. I don’t care."
Honestly a big W
Most absurd!!
"That is a complete joke if model Y is not considered a SUV. They need to eliminate these tax credits anyway, as the govt is picking/choosing who wins and the marketplace should be doing that."
Let the IRS know this needs veto change! 
Sleepy joe give then take away. Dont bit the hand that give credits
[removed]
"It’s a big car, far from an suv, not saying others on the list are SUV’s but the Y certainly is not."
Air suspension would be nice.
"Let’s be real, it’s a taller car, or more appropriately a hatchback, not an SUV."
Overprice
All things considered can someone please make them clap to Tesla
Almost as if the IRS credit thresholds were made specifically to exclude Model Ys.
"Raise the suspension by ~1 inch, add about 5kwh more battery to compensate for slight loss in efficiency. Boom! Problem solved."
"Sort of hilarious how Biden’s administration wrote these new EV credit rules to be most advantageous for the GM, Ford, Chrysler EV’s he loves to takes photos in and not the Rivian, Tesla, Lucid’s that are actually pushing the EV industry along ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|surprise)"
How is the IRS qualified to determine what is and what is not an SUV? Is that their expertise?
"Is 2022 tesla Model Y (7 seats, ordered and delivered in 2022) eligible for Fed tax credit? I was told by CPA the 2022 EV credit funding is used out there is no credit, but I am so confused by the IRS article here can anyone light me up? thanks "
A Toyota Highlander is 66k? What have we come to?
Can you charge an EV at home? How many people are going to be in the car on a average? Planning to do any major freeway or long drives?
"For build quality and reliability, Highlander."
How is your model y 81k? Plz don’t say you added FSD
The highlander will last 20 years and 300k miles
"Model Y… $81k… Does not compute. I’m guessing this is a Performance model with FSD. Unless OP has “fuck you money,” dropping $81k on a Model Y is just dumb."
Highlander
"I had a 2021 Highlander Plat AWD Hybrid and moved to a 2022 Tesla MY Performance. The MY is a much better technical experience. It handles better. The highlander is built by a company that knows how to build cars. In 21 they were pretty special but the market has aligned against it. For the money the highlander is the easy choice. If you want fast there’s a Tesla. However, you must know the Tesla range claims are hyper inflated."
This guy can’t be serious….
"If you have a good supercharger network in your area and one nearby you at work or home, as well as a good 240v home charger provisions, the Tesla is a very good option. If you live on a mountain with no roads and electricity, then the Toyota is much better."
[removed]
How the fuck is ur model y 81k??? They literally just cut prices
Isn’t the platinum highlander only 52k msrp? How did you get to 66.
[deleted]
"This has to be $CAD, right? Lol."
Highlander.
"Tesla, hands down. Relaxing to drive. Great tech. Over the air updates"
The highlanders are now coming with the turbo 4 so you are gonna get a much better quality in the ride and the gas mileage is better than the V6. Also the build quality is gonna be noticeably higher than the Tesla.
"This is a weird pair to directly compare, along with a pretty wide price difference. The Highlander is reliable and capable, although incredibly boring. $66k for a family carrying appliance seems steep. The Y is much more interesting and quick. You’ll never call it boring, although some think the interior can be lacking in luxury, especially when considering the price tag. There are many options in that price range that will offer much more luxury. It’s would be a deal breaker for me if I didn’t have a home charger."
"Probably the highlander. They have great build quality, nice interiors, last forever, cheap (comparatively) to repair/service, toyota as a whole is a better company to deal with. As for preference, I learned how to drive with a highlander, and I enjoyed how it drove. However, 66k is a lot for a highlander, my parents got theirs for 35k, a price point that makes it a solid deal. For that much money, you could get a luxury SUV like a BMW, which has a lot of really nice small features and touches here and there that make the driving experience far better, Between the two, I would choose the highlander, but for the price, you could definitely do a lot better than both IMO."
💯the Toyota

The model Y performance sells for 58k usd now on Tesla website - where did you get your 81k number from?
The Toyota.
Highlander 100%.

Another point of consideration is the Federal Credit of $7500/- if u get ur Tesla before end of March.
Have you test driven the Y? It has a very rough ride for a family hauler.
"The Highlander drives like a land yacht. I had one and now have a Model 3. If you can charge at home, get an EV!"
Model Y is freaking small. These two vehicles aren’t in the same class. If you want a fun electric car get the highlander and then a base model 3.
"Hands down the Model Y. The most fun car that I have ever driven, EVs are awesome. Safest car you’ll ever be in also. Frequent software updates make it feel like you get a new car with new features monthly."
"This is the worst place to ask, reddit hates Tesla for some weird reason. I say a test drive will answer this question for you."
"Imagine owning a car where the only maintenance you had to do within the first 5 years was changing out your tires? That’s what owning a Tesla was like for me. I despise Elon as much as the next guy, but the Model Y is a solid choice. No headaches of oil changes, smog checks, gas lines. It’s both practical and fun to drive"
For build quality and your safety pic Toyota
So I have a model x and I hate the seats. Super uncomfortable. I also never use the self driving function. It’s a fun car to drive but super noisy and the seats have caused me a lot of hip issues.
Wouldnt buy a Tesla on principle alone. Fuck Elon Musk.
"I dont even think theres a doubt here. The highlander is better all around and cheaper, just go for the highlander."
[deleted]
Highlander. I work on both and I feel the build quality isnt good on the Tesla. Feel there is almost no difference in a Model 3 and Y. The quirks of an EV arent fun either if it does have issues. It becomes a large paperweight.
Which country do you live in!?!
Buy a Toyota TRD 4Runner - instead of the Highlander. You will NOT regret it!!
In the same boat but due to the lack of charging at my rented place I am planning to get Highlander Hybrid when this crazy market settles. If my car dies down before that I will just get Model Y
If you can afford a car at that 80k price point why aren’t you looking into the luxury segment? Ur not getting 80k worth of car with a tesla.
When you go to sell it the Toyota will have retained more of its value than the Tesla.
Will Toyota make your windshield wipers go on in full sun because their software is half-baked?
Toyota Highlander. Insurance and maintenance costs will be much cheaper on the long run.
the model y is 51k after tax credits? where are you getting this number
Tesla
Easily the tesla as it just got marked down.
"Assuming you can charge at home I’d get the Y. It’ll be faster/more fun and judging from the price you’ve featured in FSD, which will not only boost the resale value but it’s a much better self driving experience than Toyota offers and you’ll get continued updates which is fun. Plus the government is subsidizing your car, which will help when you eventually resell it and the Tesla will be safer (although all modern cars areas incredibly safe so idk how much weight I’d put into that) Theoretically it’s probably more reliable too (particularly in regards to drivetrain) although if you get them new that doesn’t really matter"
"Highlander. You can drive cross-country, & fill the tank in 5min. EV’s batteries, including mining, are mostly done in Communist China by ?! Slave labor? Children? My conscience would be clearer with a Toyota, plus Highlander, in Consumer Reports, is Top 10 of all cars sold in America rated by people who have them & “would you buy it again?” (At 3yrs & 5yrs)."
"The Toyota will hold its value better. Among so many ICE cars, the Toyotas have high resale value. But as the market for EVs changes over the years, the value of the early EVs will decline even more"
"If you want an EV and can afford it (and have a charger), tesla should be the last on your list. Horrible quality control and other manufacturers are offering better quality EVs now"
"Fuck Tesla. If youre going EV get literally anything else - Audi e-Tron, Subaru Solterra, Hyundai Ionic, Mustang Mach-E, anything else. Garbage cars for a garage company that supports a garbage human. So yeah, the Highlander."
"I used to think Tesla would be a viable option, now I see it as a nod to the evils of mankind."
"If the 81k for the Model Y is solidly in your budget, Id recommend looking for an Acura or Lexus equivalent to the Highlander. If 81k is more of a stretch, Id recommend checking out Mazdas SUV offerings if you havent already. Im a bit biased because Im a big Mazda fan, but I genuinely think they make great cars. The Model Y comes with all the typical Tesla problems, but the Highlander isnt a stellar vehicle either. My mechanic had a hybrid Highlander for a while and the hybrid system was surprisingly unreliable - this may be irrelevant if youre looking at a non-hybrid, but Id definitely stay away from the hybrid. He also complained about interior quality, and specifically called it out as substantially worse than a similar (but cheaper) Hyundai. That being said, I cant recommend a Hyundai with all the engine issues theyve had. Even if you get a car with a good engine, the dealership techs will always be busy doing engine replacements for other customers."
"Just saying, 66k for a highlander is insane, if you have ever been in other vehicles in the same price range (especially from premium brand), you will know what Im talking about, Highlander is miles behind in terms of NVH, driving dynamic, material quality, etc, dont get me wrong, its a great car, but its not $66k great, regardless of the trim level."
Highlander 100% Get it and dont look back. EVs are a farce. Dont fall for it. Highlander is your answer.
We bought our 17yr old a Highlander in March. We are buying my wife a Highlander this week or next. Save money and the headaches to come and just buy the most reliable midsized SUV on the planet. You now have you go into panicky withdrawals when your phone dies. Well think about that if your copper top car goes dead.
will it be your only car? Yes - Highlander no - can consider Model Y
Tesla is trash
Support your global natural gas distributors by purchasing a r/teslamotors
Where do you live?
60 grand for a Lexus LX570.
"Are you quoting priced in USD? The non-performance Model Y is $54k. The most expensive Highlander - AWD Hybrid Platinum- is $53k. I suppose the Toyota could be $66k with sales tax and fees, but it’s basically impossible to spend that much on a Model Y. Beyond that, this is just a very weird comparison between two vehicles that most people would never cross-shop."
"$66k, for a highlander?!?"
"If the Highlander is a good fit for what you want, the Model Y will be a bad fit. The Highlander is a size bigger, both for cargo and rear passengers - and it can have an actual third row, which the Model Y says it can have but really can’t. And if you really want to drop top dollar for all the options and top trim on a family hauler why are you getting a Highlander? Just go up to the Lexus or a Porsche Cayenne like the other prep school moms. If you want to spend money on more fun the Model Y makes more sense but the Highlander is a weird choice for that."
"Honestly in my opinion, it depends where you do the most driving. If you’re in a city centre like London or New York most of the time and can easily charge it, you’d be stupid not to get a Tesla or another EV - alternates can include the Jaguar I-Pace or Fiat 500E or whatever else catches your eye. In congested cities, EVs are wonderful things. And I may added this is coming from a diehard petrol head - if anything I’m biased against electric vehicles. But if you’re predominantly in suburban or country driving, the Toyota or other petroleum powered cars are generally a better long term proposition."
"Unlike the Tesla, the Highlander comes with a spare tire. Easy decision for me."
Is this Canadian? The highlander and Tesla shouldn’t be near that high.
"In this specific comparison you are looking at, Highlander Platinum"
"I definitely wouldnt go for the Tesla. The Highlander is decent on all counts, but for Tesla money you can get the Polestar SUV, which is all-electric, MUCH more interesting and probably beats the Tesla in most metrics. &#x200B; I saw someone suggest the Mazda CX90, which looks hella cool. Probably better value than the Highlander and more interesting, but 1st year for a new model with an all new engine and hybrid drivetrain... eh. thats a pretty big risk in my opinion. I really dont understand how why the hell they chose to put an inline six into it. I mean, I love BMWs and their inline sixes, but the market is moving fast toward electrification, and putting a chonky (probably awesome) engine into a hybrid is kind of contradictory and weird to me."
Go for a NX or RX instead at 66k.
How the hell you get a MY to 81k?
Weird choice to be weighing
Toyotas are reliable but their technology sucks
I’d say Highlander hybrid
"For $66K, have you considered a Lexus RX-L or the new MDX?"
"Is this your only car or second family hauler? What are your driving habits, city/suburbs? If like to take regular trips over 150 miles and live in cold climate, don’t get EV. Batteries don’t like to get charged past 80%, 10% reduction during winter, and if you drive 75mph+ add another 5-7% for that. So your model Y is effectively a 200 mile range car. If I needed a family hauler now, I would get minivan. Sienna all the way"
Model Y specially with the federal tax credit
I am taking delivery of my Audi Q7 55 premium plus tomorrow. $75k and I would recommend it over both options.
Neither. Get a 69 Plymouth Roadrunner.
"I’d take the Tesla, especially if I’m spending much"
Highlander all day long
What about a Rav4 Prime? Feels like a good compromise between the two since it’s a plug in hybrid that’s pretty much in the middle of the two in terms of size.
Looking to do the same exact swap. Debating between rear-wheel and all-wheel right now.
Pretty generous neighbor you got there.
"We currently have 2 Bolts, a Model 3 RWD, and a Model Y Long Range. The Bolt is definitely a great commuter car but for road trips the Teslas are far superior. I will note that both of our Bolts have parking sensors but neither of our Teslas do 😆"
I’d look at sun shade for the roof.
"I have 2017 Bolt Premiere and I just got A 2020 Model 3 Long Range. I still love the Bolt but amongst all the great upgrades such as the seats, glass roof, infotainment, the charging network is what put it miles apart from the CCS chargers available. I did buy the bolt a couple years ago to test the waters of living with a EV as my sole transportation. it passed the test and now I’m excited about road trips in the Tesla. Long story short it came to this: &#x200B; Bolt= Cautious and planning on road trips Tesla= excited to go wherever I want to go and making road trips fun again 😎"
Shop around for an individual policy for your Tesla and remove it from the other one if youre the sole driver
Just went from a 2023 Bolt to a 2023 M3. If all I ever did was commute the Bolt would have been fine. Love the M3 so much more than the Bolt. The seats in the Bolt are awful - and I keep reading about how much better they are than earlier versions - M3 seats are comfortable. MyChevrolet app is all but useless - even with the $38 a month OnStar subscription. OnStar is all but useless anyway - pre smart phone it made sense but…. Love the Bolt for what it was and the price was great. But the M3 has so much more to offer. I love the functionality of the app and all I can do with it. The sound system is on another level compared to the Bolt. No regrets.
"I went from a Leaf to a model 3 and yeah it was also a sweet upgrade. Check out Temai sunshade its my favorite as it matches the car interior and has a removable liner. Also, support was really great. Enjoy!"
"Same, 2023 LT1"
Why not exclude your daughter from the Tesla on a separate policy? Its worth looking at the cost difference vs multi car policy.
"Im doing the same. But I only had the Bolt for a couple of months (oops) Had a 2021 LR that I sold in August for a small profit, bought the Bolt later, liked it, but had I known Papa Elon was going to lower prices, and Uncle Joe was giving the full 7,500 tax credit into March, I would have went straight back to another 3. Bolt is a great little car but I love to road trip, so... 🤷‍♂️ Picking up my RWD on Friday. Edit: spelling"
Congrats on drinking the Koolaid. Welcome to the fam. 😁👊
"I went from a Bolt to an M3, and honestly there is a lot I liked better about the Bolt, car play and the entertainment system much easier to use in the Chevy. Hatchback much more useful, and I still can’t send a text or make a phone call in the Tesla. Tesla for the app and driver profiles and the charging deserves all the hype it gets."
"We have a Bolt and M3LR and easily I love the Tesla more. The bolt impressed me more than I thought. Great car for the city, my wife loves it."
How much did you get for your Bolt?
"I waited for 6 months for a bolt, but GM never got their production back online. So I canceled the Bolt and ordered a Model 3 Performance the next day. Ordered 2/4 and picking up around 3/25"
"Hello fellow AZ resident 👋 If you’re in the valley I could recommend you a really good tint shop :). Eric from JustTintIt did a really good job on my car, all his prices are online. He’s in Litchfield Park though"
Picking the Nissan Leaf but not the Bolt seems wild to me. Leaf doesnt even have 200+ miles unless you buy the highest trim and go out of the $25k-$35k price range. Bolt is 250+ miles regardless of trim and starts even cheaper than the Leaf. Your driving experience between the two cars is vastly different and why the Bolt got excluded from their list is beyond me.
Interesting that they pick BMW as the #1 brand seeing as how they keep trying to nickel and dime the customers and plan to do more. Not very consumer friendly.
"After years of being touted as a smarter option for car buyers seeking better fuel efficiency and lower costs, hybrids and EVs are getting a big endorsement from Consumer Reports. The 2023 Consumer Reports 10 Top Picks for cars, trucks and SUVs includes seven models that are either hybrid or fully electric. “This really just shows how the market is changing,” said Jake Fisher, senior director of automotive testing at Consumer Reports. “Electrification, not just battery electric vehicles, but just electrification, is changing the market and making a lot of really great options.” Read more: "
"Calling a mild-hybrid an EV is like calling Chernobyl a candy store, just because there must be a jar of twizzlers laying around somewhere..."
"Consumer reports not analyzing stats properly. Bolt looks bad because recalls, but refresh just came out. You need to judge 2022 vs 2022. Right now, model y and 3 are mature platforms with minimal chance for failures and headaches. They need to include objective data vs subjective. Whats the average amount of time you will send in shop doing repairs, maintenance, and renergizing. Bevs are now crossing the threshold where they are significantly less maintenance and headache factor of an ice. Everyones 1st gen is gonna suck."
Can’t wait for all the Tesla fans to tell us how Consumer Reports has no idea what they’re talking about and is no longer relevant and is paid by legacy auto.
Theres very little reason for Teslas to be so popular still. Shite build quality plus theyre led by a idiot who has effectively flipped public opinion because he cant shut the hell up.
List of dumbest things to do: 1) Reinvent the wheel
Yoke would work awesome with drive-by-wire. We don’t have drive-by-wire as an approved option for mass produced transit. Therefore - do not offer yoke as the only available option.
"How does all this touch stuff work in winter when youre wearing gloves, or have dry/split finger tips?"
The worst piece of design since the Cybertruck
The thing im confused on is when the yoke came out why did people start hating stalks? Now everyone ( mostly Tesla fans) want stalks gone. Like they service a purpose and arent in the way. Edit: based my comment on a somewhat small sample size from close friends and discord didnt mean to generalize. Apologies if I offended anyone.
A yoke can only really work with steer-by-wire which means you never have to turn the wheel over half a revolution.
[deleted]
The ultimate answer to a question no one ever asked.
"I love my yoke, would buy another one with it given the choice."
"""It could take years before you get used to it."" Every person Ive seen who talked about owning the yoke says they get used to it very quickly. He also didnt seem to understand how to use the high beams which is just a hard press for toggle. Maybe he could read the manual? In general he complains because things arent how expects them. Like he complained about the wiper controls because they arent the same as the Model 3 as if thats the only ""correct"" way for them to pop up? Every new car has muscle memory changes."
"Having driven with a yoke for over a year now, I love it."
If you are unable to indicate correctly through a roundabout (or anywhere else) then you must not drive the vehicle. It is unfit for purpose until you are actually capable of operating the vehicle safely.
"This is the first step, wait for steer-by-wire. Then the yoke is no joke anymore."
I get off on yoke hate porn
No English speakers speaking English jumbling their words no thanks
"Heres a 1000 HP car and a shitty steering wheel to steer it, good luck!"
"Interesting review but there are quite a few subjective items I would disagree on. Infotainment - Im a ""young tech loving millennial"" and thinks its awful. To specify I think having climate control and audio controls and glove box controls on the touch screen is seriously dangerous and should really be legislated out. I am also not a fan of the interior, I dont think it feels like a nice place to be that is minimalist. To me it feels like a polyvinyl fake leather doctors waiting room where despite looking around for the 2 hour wait, sparks literally no joy. I almost expect to see some monthly magazines strewn about rhe place like good housekeeping or womens own. Noise, double glazing is great but both the y and 3 Ive been in have rather excessive road noise from the tyres and wheel Wells, especially in the back. Also the software issues cannot be downplayed, just yesterday I know someone had the cars lane following ability try to steer him into a car next to him suddenly and without warning. Obviously - subjective and your opinion is yours, but I have not been a fan as a passenger of teslas."
"Interesting points to read while reflecting on my 2023 I-pace. I’m jealous of your 35 miles per hour on 7KW, I only get 14 miles per hour, but on the flipside my winter range seems far better at around 220 miles. I’m also not quite ready for the full touch screen infotainment, I like the fusion of tactile controls for basic stuff such as temperature and volume but with the touchscreen for CarPlay. I’m sure the Tesla has better driving assist, although I’m happy with lane keep plus adaptive cruise. I guess it’s subjective but I’ve never been a fan of the Tesla styling - perhaps they prioritised aero which is fair enough, but I always thought the model Y in particular looks very blobby. Still better than whatever BMW are doing though (apart from the i4)!"
Decent and honest review. I quite like Teslas but the interior quality does put me off a bit. If I were going for a new or very lightly used one I think I’d go for the Ioniq 5 but with the early Model 3s getting much more affordable second hand now they’re hard to ignore.
"Efficiency of hydrogen would be vastly improved if we made the grid carbon free, which means more nuclear power realistically. Not sure what youre on about with NOx and hydrogen. Waste from the tailpipe is water."
"I’m in similar situation - have a 2021 model 3 sr plus. I agree with a lot of points. Like someone else on here I also feel that the infotainment is actually quite bad- my wife has an Audi a3 - her virtual cockpit display, satnav, stereo system, and wireless CarPlay are all a lot better in my opinion. The tesla build is okay but not in same class as bmw Audi merc Lexus. One aspect I think that’s important is that for a car, it’s great - handles well, is fun to drive and powertrain is incredible. The main negative for me is technology not being what you’d expect and that it’s really embarrassing driving something so closely linked to Elon. I also really like no tax, no servicing and supercharger network is quite good. The used prices seem extremely low right now aswell so I think make a great buy."
Some of those cons are outrageous. How are they even allowed to happen??
"The interior is one of my favourite aspects. Literally no other car on sale has the same airy feeling of space. Individual vents and sculpted dashboards are just dust traps and yet, the Tesla interior still maintains all the same functionality. Folks (often without any experience) will bemoan the all-in-one screen but fail to recognise that this is the way the industry is going, electric powered or otherwise. Its just better. Dangerous? If youre stupid enough to take your eyes off the road in a situation that would put you in danger then you probably shouldnt be driving full stop. For those of us who *actually* live with them, I can adjust the temperature when stationary (seriously how often do you do this when going down a winding road anyway!?) Or use voice commands. Either works great. Theres a lot of misinformed nonsense surrounding Teslas online and its strange how polarising of an issue it is. I literally chose mine because it was both the fastest and cheapest company car I could get. But to sit and read countless commentary online about ""meh, build kwality"" or ""eh, no HUD"" from inexperienced people who themselves drive something slower, more technology-depraved old crappy cars is absolutely mind-blowing to me. Yes, your clattery 2.0 diesel BMW is really the pinnacle of a driving experience, you absolute melts! Theyre not the be-all and end-all, but lets get real; theyre considerably better *in every metric* than most generic humdrum petrol or diesel cars out there on sale, save for a few very special sports cars and super cars."
">5) Hydrogen etc is definitely viable but again the fueling infrastructure isnt something that can easily be set up and therefore currently EVs are the only real alternative regardless of what politics/conspiracies you believe are at play. Just to wade into the debate (thanks for the review btw). I disagree on the viability, partially. Hydrogen I dont think has a future for passenger. For Hydrogen Fuel Cell, the cost (initial and running) will be off-putting, and the lack of infrastructure. The well to wheel efficiency is awful (generating, transporting, storing each have losses). For ICE hydrogen that well to wheel efficiency is even worse, and you have NOx emissions on top. For commercial vehicles (long haul, trans-european etc), I think thats more likely where time criticality has a larger impact on the economics. It also allows a smooth transition with fuel agnostic ICE coming to the market... *what to change your fuel? Sure, just change the head and away you go...* (in theory)."
"I have never understood why the is not a HUD on a Tesla, stopped me from buying one tbh."
"I was telling a friend the other day that lately that I felt as if Tesla drivers ALWAYS had their high beams on, and it seemed like it was more the Model 3 and the Y. I assumed they just put some bright ass lights on them but now I see why."
10 of 10 nailed the landing.
I wish somebody with a fuck ton of money would reincarnate what Lotus was originally intended to be - just a simple as fuck automobile. Engine + transmission + body+ chassis + wheels = car It can be a EV or ICE I don’t care as long as it’s simple and effective. I don’t care about all this extra BS that doubles the price of a car and ends up breaking within 5 years. Just give me a CAR
*screams like a girl. NSX!
This is why Ive decided to just spend too much money on JDM import cars from the 90s for the rest of my life instead of buying modern vehicles.
"I, too, would like to keep OPs NSX."
"I will never own a car that has remotely controlled functionality, or is ""connected"" to anything. This is a disaster waiting to happen. I dont care if I have to drive a 20 year old vehicle. So be it."

"I have a 2019 Model 3 and can only relate to the auto wipers complaint, they seem to go full blast in a drizzle and it does force them on when using the ADAS features. The auto high beams were quite bad when I got the car but actually began working quite well in a recent update. I haven’t experienced any of the other issues but I never really use the summon feature and I also use an iPhone so can’t speak to the reliability when using an Android device. I also own a boosted 94 Miata and a big turbo B5 S4. Model 3 is my DD, and I like the low maintenance, operating cost, and just overall low effort of it. I’ve spent years owning a lot of high maintenance stuff (big turbo B5 S4…) and it’s nice to go to the complete opposite side of the spectrum with such a no-fuss car."
All your complaints were problems that my 2019 came with from brand new haha..
Good thing your 2 backup cars are some of the best cars ever 👌
This is 1 of a couple of reasons Im so against owning a Tesla. I dont want another always connected device whose firmware/software updates are out of my control. Its jarring enough when forced phone/tablet/computer/device completely change everything without your consent. Its another to mess with a car and cause safety hazards because crap is constantly changing while youre asleep. And besides that I dont want MY driving habits and routes phoning home to who knows where for god only knows what reason.
"Most of the stuff that is F’d up and not working, are things nobody really needs in the first place. Gimmicks. Annoying overpriced dysfunctional gimmicks."
"I’m sorry dude but Tesla is the absolute worst when it comes to QC. You couldn’t have expected much in the way of QC when it comes to updates seeing the way some of his cars are delivered. I actually liked Tesla but that dude is unstable, between the price drops and increases and him just not quite grasping how an auto manufacturer should actually function. He needs to hire a former ceo or hire someone from the auto industry and just stay out of the way. I’m so curious what his plan is when all these model Y’s start having issues or just need servicing, there’s no where near enough service centers to handle how many cars are hitting the road. I love being able to purchase on line and not deal with a jerkoff salesmen. I can’t see this bubble getting to much bigger before it bursts. People like you that are have gone from owning the best car ever to driving the lowest model Nissan in a rental fleet and saying that car is better say’s something about the company and after sales care"
The Worst in reliability…
Good to know
"The lack of physical controls on the Teslas really put me off them. Touchscreens are not good for car controls. On the subject of wipers though, as the owner of an old (2008!) Ford with auto-wipers which are 98% perfect I find it bizarre that something that should only have got better with years of advances in technology...is worse. The only times Ive turned my wipers off auto are summer evenings when the myriad of flies would trigger it and leave a smeary mess if they wiped and in the depths of winter when the salty spray would equally leave a smeary mess. Both of those are really edge cases that computers would *really* struggle with."
Tesla is the only major auto manufacturer in the world without a quality system certification such as [ISO](
92 NSX is THE way.
"Genuine question, those that spend over $100k on a Tesla, like the Model S, what took them away from a Taycan which is similarly priced?"
I would buy the key fob. It connects better than a phone.
Hell yeah enjoy that NSX
"I definitely will not be buying a new car in the future. These dictatorial fucks like the EU can ban new ICE cars all they like, Im still going to keep mine running. It is more environmentally friendly for the planet to repair and reuse your current stuff. Theres a reason right to repair smartphones is getting more traction. Same applies to cars. Weve already seen Merc and BMW try it with their subscription bullshit, no thank you. Ill stick to my 08 Ford Fiesta thats possibly the brightest green ever, with an aftermarket JVC radio and absolutely no fancy computer controls. THAT is a car."
EVs are NOT the Future
"Weird. My 2019 model 3 has only gotten better. Does autowipers still suck? Yes. Does auto high beams still suck? Yes. Camera based autopilot as a whole has improved a lot over radar based though, and for 90% of *my* driving autowipers and beams are not an issue. Connectivity issues is a YMMV thing that always seems to be phone related. I’ve had no issues. Summon is still problematic, always has been. Although I feel it’s more stable now I do experience the issue where I have to go back and forth/close the app every other time and I have to use it daily. But no car is perfect. My 2005 A6 would crash its infotainment. Had a BMW 4-series where the navigation would die and you had two options. Park the car and wait, or disconnect the battery. Software is complex and hard, but Tesla software is leaps ahead of other. If you don’t like finding new bugs I highly recommend changing your update schedule away from advanced."
Tesla? Quality? Oh look I have wet myself from laughing.
"Step one, never use autopilot. Its a death trap."
MFW people spend tens of thousands on a tesla
"My 22 year old Saab just works and refuses to die, I move practically brand new cars in and out of the warehouse at work when someones borrowing the pool car for example and all the shit in there I find so distracting and unncessary. Enjoy your NSX dude."
"You would think the years of being rated as one of the most unreliable car companies would make people not want to buy one, lol"
"remember when elon said: ""Almost all input is error. Car should do the right thing automatically."""
"As with most software, it’s unfortunate, but compatibility is such a big deal. I say this jokingly but, just buy an iPhone. It’s like you get tied into an ecosystem simply based on its popularity, because you know that ecosystem has more support and will see updates rolled out sooner."
"This is why I will never buy a modern car. I’ll take my 12 year old, slow as shit, falling apart Corolla over any of this subscription bullshit or the blind spot sensors that new cars have. The amount of times I’ve been cut off by cars that have the blind spot sensors is insane. The more safety features that are added, the lazier people get when they’re driving. It’s dangerous and just bullshit. If you can’t check your own goddamn blind spot without the help of a sensor, you should not be driving."
You have been Musked.
I can’t help but think that’s going to cause some kind of damage to the wheels.
"OP, thanks for more pictures. Since you do this kind of regularly, do you think youll get one of those bar things you drive over and hook straps to so it doesnt eventually mess with the integrity of the wheels?"
So THATS an over the air update.
""
not sure those wheel spokes were engineered for this kind of load

Is there no way to drive the car onto the boat? My heart would stop every time I do that.
"There has got to be a plate that you drive onto with places for the crane to grab.... But its your car, so no worries. If you were doing that to other peoples cars, then I would hope for something a little better."
They call it the *Model Two Trey*

"How long have you been doing this for? Its cool that you can take your car with you like that. I would share other peoples concerns about the suspensions, but Im guessing you probably went through all that when you first started lifting it like that."

I like my Tesla grounded lol
I always wondered how those cars got on those European river ships!
"Wow… holy crap. That’s not how you do it, there should be, at a minimum, braces (or ideally a flatbed) beneath each wheel which mimic the forces applied to the wheel when in motion or when the vehicle is not moving. The stress applied to the various bushings and other support structures in this example are extreme."
Lol this made me laugh. Can you post more photos like this whenever you get a car onboard?
What boat is this? Where?
New alignment incoming
Why do I feel like this is ripping the axel apart?
Hoist points on the wheels?? That seems like it would screw up the suspension…
FYI w all the hype in here. You hitting bumps at highway speed would put more stress on the suspension system than doing this. Believe it or not if strapped correctly it’s like the car is sitting on the ground. VERY COOL pics!!!!! It’s cool you can take it w you like that. What foreign cities have you got to drive it in??
I love seeing balanced rigging
I had a similar thing. I took pictures and submitted a service request. Mine was like a wax that was incorrectly applied to the plastic trim. It wouldnt come off. Tesla replaced them for free.
"If it bothers you, report it in a ticket right away so that it can be documented. :-)"
"Contact Tesla, they should replace it for free."
"Tesla fixed all the blemishes I found within 100 miles including scratches on gear stick, upholstery on backseat that was not flush, grease stain on leather. Put in a service request immediately and submit the photo. They resolved my issues rather quickly."
"Is that not just a plastic piece that pops right off? Should be easily replaceable by Tesla, just open a service appt in the app"
black light that
"Egh, you could ask Tesla to try to clean it, or just leave it as is and youll forget about it after a few weeks. The babying of the car is like the worst aspect of being a new owner lol."
Get tesla to replace the trim
"If you tell Tesla, they’ll give you a new one"
Its a clip on part that comes prepainted. Contact Tesla ASAP.
"OP, really like that color. Might you know it’s name?"
you kidding me brother? that thing is totaled.
Totaled
Within specs.
You sure it isn’t just a bit of dirt?
Probably don’t mention it has been treated etc at a detailer as they may deny a request saying it could have been caused by them
"Wow, I’m jealous, yours is not falling off like mine!"
Just leave it… ITS A CAR!
Magic Eraser maaaay do the trick
Someone is getting a new battery for a brand new model x vehicle and you are complaining about a stain?!
"Super easy to be replaced. Fender garnish is the name. If they make you pay (sue to not being able to prove if it was delivered that way or caused by external factors), it’s like $100, for parts and labor."
Too high price (and no tax credit) for too low of range. This won’t sell much in the USA: if I were a Lexus-only buyer: I would buy a Lexus rx350 hybrid (gets 36 mpg combined); it starts at about $50.1k . And if I were an BEV buyer: then I probably would buy a model Y or ID4 or even a Lyriq.
Model Y now starts at $55k. Price just went up.
Probably another $5k dealer markup since they can’t produce that many and months of waiting. Almost dead on arrival with that short range. Rather just get a MY or GV60.
I genuinely don’t understand buying this or the BZ4X. You basically get a Chevy Bolt and pay double or triple the price.
220 miles? LMAO total joke. Real world will be less than 200 for sure.
Toyotas cause of death? HUBRIS!!
"Take the worst-value electric SUV on sale today, make it even uglier, make it only come in the AWD version that takes almost 90 minutes to charge and has no guarantee of functioning in the cold, and price it the same as a GV60 and $6k more than a Model Y. Oh, and then when it sells 3k units a year and dealers refuse to take any because it hurts their margins, say ""EV CULTISTS are trying to FORCE you into TERRIBLE CARS! Clearly the only solution is hydrogen!!"""
"Toyota/Lexus, like Audi and others, need to come with a 2nd Gen EV platform."
"Aaah, it’s 220 miles of range. No thanks."
The range is just so dismal there’s no way this thing sells at all
DOA. I am no Tesla fan boy but Toyota really doesnt have their shit together for EVs
"Seriously, heads should be rolling at most of the Japanese car companies. This is shameful. I was hardcore Toyota / Lexus buyer - but their constant advocacy against electrification, their mediocre offerings, all combine to make it hard to want to spend my money with them. We want a new minivan and the Sienna is the best of them out there right now for our use case, and there is no real EV option that has similar packaging. But I am trying to hold out for something else."
"And, dont forget, Lexus itself says ""**DC Charging may not work on AWD RZ when the temperature is below 0 degrees Celsius**."" [Link]( \- Under ""Level 3 Fastest"" click on disclaimer."
"I’d take a premium ER eAWD Mach-E over this tarted up bz4x. 220 mile range at this price point is a hard sell for me. If it has the same charging performance of the bz4x, forget about it."
Tesla can only make so many cars and not everyone likes their styling so unless Lexus is planning to make over 100k a year I doubt they will have a big issue selling them all. I am also told MSRP means nothing and dealers will add or subtract from the price as they see fit.
Meh
And the Lexus IS starts at 20k more than Toyota Corolla… What a headline!
How much for the model where the wheel stays on the car?
"No need to add ""6k more than the Tesla model y."" Might as well add all the other EV models out there too."
I would bet anything that 6K would be well worth it just in build quality
"Obligatory reminder that Tesla’s range figures are inflated compared to other automakers. Better range, but not as much better as it might seem."
"Nobody buys a Lexus suv for the drivetrain. It is true luxury unlike the pretend shit Tesla is trying for. Given it’s under $60k, which is a steal for luxury, I question all the compromises that we’d get. Is this just a Toyota with a Lexus badge?"
Worth it for better quality all around. I rented a Model Y from Hertz last weekend and it had to be towed from my driveway due to a bad wheel bearing.
I sat in one at the LA autoshow and boy that alcantara interior was nice. Too bad the range sucks
"Meh, PHEV is better choice as of today."
That range is laughable for the money asked
"Until Toyota/Lexus actually builds an EV on a dedicated platform, I’m staying away."
The E-tron and Taycan are charging beasts. I really hope they sell an e-Tron GT liftback (or a wagon) in the USA at some point.
Bjorn sounded like a guy calling a horse race. Good times.
Bjorn doing it the fun and informative way. Need miles added as well.
"I tried getting this type of information using an OBDII reader on my EV, but other than OBD voltage, it does not show anything? Does the car need to support these values or is it available through OBD port? My car is Tata nexon EV."
"Tesla really needs to update their charging curves across the board. I understand they’re being conservative, but the speeds really start to drop off quickly past 50%. If the rumors are true, V4 should push the max power higher than 250kW"
Power is irrelevant. The entire purpose is to add range. The only metric that matters is distance added per minute. And the comparison can’t be to a given state of charge. It has to be over a given distance. E.g. 70% Plaid state of charge > 100% of the others.
"That Plaid is definitely charging a bit slower than most for some reason, most I’ve hold 250 kW into the 30’s and some near 40%"
There is no chemistry breakthrough. Allowing faster dc fast charging is bad for battery health. Their warranty allow a lot of degradation. Fat etrons are showing premature degradation. 800v vs 400v is just ignorant. The volt for the cell is about the same anyway. Sodium batteries can charge faster but less dense.
My Honda has a driver assist thing. It’s like an advanced cruise control that will keep you centered in lanes and make steering adjustments for you. If you don’t keep a hand on the wheel the car keeps beeping at you and the dash flashes. Tesla needs to do that with their fake autopilot. Safety over luxury user experience.
"“Although drivers tend to blame the FSD for their mistakes when a crash happens, this time, the driver was right, as data released by the federal government on Tuesday confirms. According to the investigation’s report cited by CNN, the controversial driver-assist software was activated roughly 30 seconds before the crash. The data also shows that the car abruptly slowed to 7 mph (11 kph), a dangerous move in fast-moving traffic. It’s not certain what causes the phantom braking, which Tesla has yet to figure out and fix. Tesla has stripped its cars from every sensor except video cameras, which might be the main cause. After all, humans experience optical illusions, although rare. It could be that certain conditions, like a shadow moving fast across the camera, could trick the system into thinking there’s an object in front of the car and trigger a hard brake.” FSD may have been engaged but I believe FSD switches to AP on the interstate."
"At least 5 motorcycle riders have been murdered by Tesla AP/FSD, nobody seems to understand the urgent safety emergency these broken systems have caused."
"> A Tesla Model S that braked sharply, triggering an eight-vehicle crash on I-80 in San Francisco last November, had the EV maker’s FSD Beta engaged seconds before the crash. Information was confirmed by data the federal government released Tuesday."
Tesla: Not our fault. Read the fine print!
"""The FSD Beta software is pretty expert at finding the way in various traffic situations, and sometimes it behaves like an expert driver for hours in a row"" This has literally never been my experience. I havent made it more than 5 minutes without FSD beta doing something completely idiotic. the other day, I took the risk of trying it out again on neighborhood streets. it approached intersection and attempted to pull up against the car at the other side of the ""KEEP CLEAR"" section. I had to disengage it to prevent it from impeding on the clearly marked area. this isnt a new concept. tons of roads are marked with sections that say keep clear, like in front of fire stations. this is BASIC driving, not even advanced. traffic circles? absolutely horrific at them. I had to disengage when it was showing no signs of yielding to a vehicle that was already clearly past the last turn it could make before crossing in front of me"
Ban FSD until it works on a privately constructed “complicated as the real world” test track. Why is this even a question or debate? How is it ok that my family and I get to be the Guinea pigs for some lazy inconsiderate fucker that doesn’t want to have to drive themselves? Still sleepy? Stay the fuck home. Wanna play on your phone while you go to work…take the fuckin bus you worthless bastards. I hope Tesla is sued completely out of business eventually.
Damn this motherfucker. I have seen these toddler strollers there and it is so emraging to think the tech bros wanna use their little beta softwarez on public roads.
Who pays for the damages?
"So all the bills are being sent to Tesla, right?"
"Weve all been through this with Trump. Something obviously bad is done, then they come out and immediately deny it, then when the confirmation hits a few days/weeks later people have forgotten and the denial is used as a refutation of the confirmation of the truth."
"I wonder if this has something to do with Tesla trying to depend on cameras more than the front radar sensors. The cameras would see a black wall coming up at high speed because of the shadow, but the radar would know that there was no obstacle there and should take priority."
This closes the one excuse people are saying driver was inattentive for awhile so the car decided to slowdown.
Phantom braking? I never would have guessed!!
">The FSD Beta software is pretty expert at finding the way in various traffic situations, and sometimes it behaves like an expert driver for hours in a row. This leads people to believe the system is good enough to rely on for everyday “driving.” Then, people get careless, attention slips, and, at the worst possible moment, they get a brutal reminder that FSD Beta is called “beta” for a reason. So, a couple of notes that I think are important for public safety: 1. The human driver is always driving when FSD Beta is active. FSD Beta requires an attentive human driver fallback ***at all times*** \- the exact same as if the vehicle was not equipped with a partial automated driving system at all; and 2. It is best to avoid anthropomorphizing engineered systems. Karpathy did this often and it is absurd - and dangerous. FSD Beta is not an ""expert"" at anything, nor is any automated driving system. What should be internalized is that engineered, safety-critical systems are validated within a target set of automated capabilities and within an Operational Design Domain (ODD) - ***the same as any other safety-critical system***. This distinction keeps the public from assigning human-like intelligence qualities and ethics to automated driving systems - which will only water down their own understanding of system limitations; and 3. It is important to recognize that the term ""beta"" really has no meaning in safety-critical system parlance and it is especially meaningless for safety-critical systems provided to consumers that are outside of the system safety lifecycle for the program. Tesla is using the term as a cynical ""liability shift"" and it has ***zero*** meaning beyond that. Consumers should not be expected to appreciate that at ""the worse possible moment""."
No government sources link = Source: trust me bro!
"The headline is just false it’s literally not possible to activate FSD on this highway, FSD only works on local roads like ones with traffic lights etc, not highways. Car was probably on autopilot if anything."
"I cant seem to find the official report by NHTSA. AutoEvolution is citing CNN, and when I look at the CNN article, there isnt citing either. Please link me to the official NHTSA report or any information thats directly from NHTSA. Thank you. (To be clear, Im not saying that Im doubting that FSD or Autopilot was engaged. Im just seeking trustworthy details and facts.) The AutoEvolution article states: >According to the investigation’s report cited by CNN, the controversial driver-assist software was activated roughly 30 seconds before the crash."
The software needs work but wtf was the driver doing?
Sell your Tesla and buy a BYD.
Driving 101 - Follow the car in front of you at a distance that is enough to stop if you need to.
Further proof Tesla is under charging people to be beta testers for this amazing software.
The driver should still have been paying to smash the pedal in time. We cant trust tech 100%.
"So, this is pretty damning. But at the end of the day, the driver had ample time to accelerate and correct the issue. The driver is still part of this equation. Tesla needs to make a better system here to maintain safety. Just turning off is not the answer. And if it is instructed to pull over when its been forcibly disengaged due to an inattentive driver (but wont because its in a tunnel), then it should be able to go to the next safest point and pull over. This is a join issue between Tesla and the driver and both parties should be held liable."
"Even if it was a phantom breaking issue, the driver is still responsible. An attentive driver would have noticed the car breaking for no apparent reason and tapped the accelerator to keep the vehicle moving at a safe speed. This accident was caused by driver error."
Amazing how many fake crap articles there on this crap sub.
"Something stinks about all of this because FSD Beta is not active on freeways (yet, not until V11 which right now is only on employee cars). Theres a distinct visual difference in whats on the screen when FSD beta is active, and the news videos of them driving through same tunnel clearly shows it not active. Now it could have been the EAP (enhanced auto pilot) but thats totally difference code from the beta FSD."
"It would be autopilot on the highway , not FSD. Details are hard."
FSD doesn’t work on the highway this was AP and misinformation in the news once more.
100% driver’s mistake. He had plenty of time to disengage
FSD doesn’t work on the highway this was AP and misinformation in the news once more.
"FSD on highway? Smh. Lets say AP was engaged, it looks like the driver missused the software and didnt nag the wheel or was distracted, why AP tried to stop the car. An attentive driver (as you agree to when using the software), would just have taken control and kept driving. Clearly this is the drivers fault for missusing the software."
"Its always struck me how people were willing to accept FSD even though its such a new technology, I know in the future itll be amazing but to get there things will have to be sacrificed to iron out the kinks like any new piece of technology. Like take aviation for example its only become this safe because of the numerous deaths and accidents that have shone a light onto its problems. What makes FSD any different?"
"Please force Tesla to recall and fix this issue. Please force Tesla to recall and fix this issue. Please please please. I don’t use autopilot very often because the phantom braking is too scary. Since Tesla doesn’t want to even acknowledge it, I really hope they are forced by regulators to either fix the problem or disable it in all vehicles (Tesla would choose to find a fix I think)."
So what is the real cost of Tesla? Double think helps me think Elon is swag
"Theyre over there in tm in complete denial. That sub is nothing more than an ""Elon is great!"" circle-jerk."
"If thats true, they need to sue Telsa for calling it ""Full Self Driving"", and marketing it as the name sounds in plain English. Unbelievable. How is this not False Advertising?"
"They should just set the onboard ""autopilot"" to fully self immolate any time a crash is about to happen. That way it can never be autopilots fault because it ceased to exist and human driver was the only responsible party left in the car"
All he had to do was stomp on the accelerator! I don’t understand how someone could let this happen!
Every tesla buyers are right wing terrorists knowing their funds are fueling the far right and still continue to pirchase their cars
The side cameras in most Teslas are known to leak light and be defective. The FSD software cannot deal with light leaks inside the housing. They have not recalled these cars and it is a known reason why FSD will never be out of Beta. Its a dirty little not-so-secret.
"I have fsd and have my concerns with it but basic road rules 101 say that if you hit someone in front of you it’s your fault, not theirs. Yeah, phantom braking is an issue that Tesla hasn’t fixed but I struggle to see how it’s the teslas fault other cars slammed into it. They were following too close and should be ticketed as such. Driver should have took over and accelerated, yes, but doesn’t remove the fact they were rear ended by cars following too close."
"I agree, its not a perfect system. I also experienced phantom braking in the past, but ultimately, the driver is in control of the vehicle. How can the driver allow the car to come to a complete stop on the freeway? Was the driver not paying attention? Why didnt he step on the accelerator? Did he just sit there dumbfounded? It is 100% his fault, just as if he would have stepped on the brake himself. Ultimately who is getting the ticket, the driver or the car?"
"I wish tesla added bright colored lights that indicated when a tesla had FSD or AP enabled to other drivers. As it stands, i just give a wide berth to Teslas now."
"The fact that the car slowed to 7mph is evidence enough that the driver was not paying attention and not capable of taking over in an emergency situation—something that autopilot (and fsd) as well as literally every other level 2 system requires, and Tesla and other manufacturers make this very clear. Anyone who uses any current driver assist system without being ready to take over is extremely negligent. I can’t think of a situation in which my car could slow from highway speeds to 7mph without being capable of taking over the gas pedal short of not being in the driver seat or completely passed out."
So now the car will be full of dead ants? Are they going to remove all of the dead insects?
"There isn’t long waits on teslas right now, just accept a new one"
Dont accept. Get another one.
"Just wait for an OTA ( over the air update) Oh wait , wrong bugs."
The ozone will destroy those ants and every other living creature in there. Its _how_ they got into the car in the first place you need to worry about.
"I am in the Tesla thread a bit and have never heard of this. Not sure your location but people are getting Fremont cars in less then a week right now. I personally would decline and get a new one. Not so much the ants, although weird, but the added work on the car to clean."
"It’s isn’t the ants you need to fear, it’s the techs trying to put everything together. That car gonna rattle. Also, I’ve used ozone machines before, but never to get rid of ants? Doesn’t entirely add up. Also also, you probably have ants where you live. If it IS the adhesive….we’ll you know the rest."
"Did you at least do your best Zoolander impression and ask ""what is this, a car for ants!?"""
"They are going to do this ozone treatment anyway. Even if you refuse this car, they will try to send it to another customer. So it’s not like you’re putting them out by initially asking for the ozone treatment. My recommendation to you is to ask for a new car. It’s something that you will always know about, and always remember. 1000 dead ants inside of body panels is pretty gross!"
"Ozone is pretty corrosive. Id worry about it damaging the car, or at least putting premature wear on the interior."
This might be better suited for the Tesla subreddit. I’m not sure what “ozoning” a vehicle would entail but in the property management world ozone is just getting rid of smell. So if that was the vocabulary used I would ask for a significant and detailed report as to what equipment and chemicals were used.
"Most Tesla models are sub-30 day lead times right now. Walk away, get another vehicle."
True ozone machines (as opposed to just ionizing) will kill just about any microorganism including ants.
"If they know this is a problem why are there not using a different adhesive? I’ve never heard of this before, not in any vehicle other than a Tesla. Does this mean anyone who has a Tesla within a certain range of the production facility may have issues with ants for the entirety of their ownership?"
Lol. Tesla vehicles have the weirdest issues.
> ants are attracted to an adhesive that they use during production. I think in the automotive industry this would lead to a recall. The service peeps may not know the root cause and were just saying anything to appease you.
I can order a new one and get it delivered next week. There is no delay on a new order. Don’t make a mistake over expedience. Get the new one. I swear to god…issues only Tesla seems to have.
"If it is the adhesive, then isnt there no fix unless they magically remove all of the adhesive (and thus let the car fall apart)? Even if they kill all of the ants currently in the car, isnt this car just going to attract more ants later? I would not take delivery."
Ive heard Teslas.are buggy!
As a two time Tesla owner from Fremont this is weird... I would.habe rejected the car. Model 3 turnaround is quick. Model Y LR is backed up months.
If you’re not getting a significant rebate (unlikely) then you should definitely reject it and get a new one.
lemon send it back...the car is compromised.
What is this? A CAR FOR ANTS?!?
"After seeing an ant issue on a car - something I have never heard of, you are still willing to buy that car? This would destroy any quality credibility I would have with the company. No one in the pre-sale inspection noticed all those ants? No confidence. Would not even buy a different new M3."
"If your new car is filled with ants, dead or alive, you absolutely should reject it. If they have overlooked an ant infestation in quality control before delivery, what else have they overlooked? You’ll be stuck with a car with lower resale value once you sell it in a few years. I know you wanted to meet the March rebate deadline, but keep in mind that more and more car companies offer EVs, much higher in quality than Tesla."
Not a new problem. Evidence here: [
Ask for a refund
I wouldn’t accept a car that needed this who knows what damage the car will take during the process even just removing and replacing parts could cause issues. If this is a known problem based on materials used by the company I’d seriously reconsider buying a Tesla at all. I’ve never purchased a vehicle that had any known issues especially a new vehicle. I’d want to keep up that standard.
"Id get a new one or shop for something else. I would be looking around for ants constantly for months. I can imagine picking up carry out, get it home and feel this constant need to inspect every bite for ants."
"I’ve used ozonators quite a bit and they’ll scorch your lungs if you stay in the vicinity while the ozonator’s running. Ozone can be compared to the reaction of what happens when lightning strikes with the atmospheric air around us - similar to the smell/scent of a rainstorm with lightning. However, not only does it spell doom for your lungs if you’re in the vicinity while it’s being produced (while the treatment’s in process that is) it destroys fungus, mold, and other nasty things including insects. But it can damage electronics also - due to the oxygenation process. Electronics and ozone is not a good combo."
"Id refuse delivery and get a new one and hope that the new one doesnt use adhesive that attracts ants. If you live in the Seattle area those tiny sugar ants are everywhere. It wouldnt be a matter of if you got another infestation, its when."
"You should have taken a new order, or tried to ask for a significant discount."
Did not have a clue that we had so many ant experts😇
"DO NOT ACCEPT. I’ve seen cars that were roach infested still have roaches after FIVE bombings. 1 bombing might not be enough. If the queen doesn’t die, they will all by back."
"Our Model 3 is a great car, but this is another example of a rookie mistake. On one hand, it is great that Tesla is on the leading edge of technology and on the other hand, they make stupid mistakes because they lack the experience of the established brands. An experienced engineer would have looked at the properties of that adhesive in intricate detail before deploying it in mass production."
I’m sorry to ask and sorry if it’s already been talked about but what’s this march 1st deadline? I thought this new credit was going to last
I dont think ants damage anything in a car. Seems like its an annoyance but it should be fine.
How many tons? How were they measured?
"why the fuck are you buying a tesla you moron? do you idiots never learn anything? reject the delivery and get an electric vehicle from literally any car manufacturer that, you know, actually knows how to make cars without letting them get infested with ants and having the fucking steering wheel fall off randomly."
I had ants in a car of mine last year. We moved to a new place and the ants left. Never found any bodies or anything left behind. It just kind of solved itself once the car moved away from wherever they were coming from.
"I think about how whenever I take something apart and put it back together, it always has one thing that just doesn’t fit or look right. So now imagine your car…. I’d have gotten a whole new one and demanded a discount or something other than Uber since they knew the ants could be an issue but never did a last QC check for any. Once they had the ants, will they vacuum them up..? What chems or treatments are they applying to the vehicle AND are they flushing AC systems and filters so you, your pets, your kids don’t get sick m??? Will this happen to you again when you bring the car home? All things to think about"
embrace the ants
Ozone will work but they’ll need to detail it
"Yea, unless you need the car now i would have them sell it to someone else and get back in que. Ants going into cars isnt normal unless something attracted them there. You could be unlucky and while it was outside a queen managed to get inside and the others followed when it was raining. Its a stretch."
I would not take delivery. Ask for a different one
"answer is mothballs, I have to use them to keep ants out of electrical boxes, motors, appliances - anything outside here in Floriduh. IDK if they’re attracted to the electrical current or it’s just a coincidence, but they’re much more common in areas with an electrical circuit, AC or DC. Maybe Teslas should come with a lifetime supply of mothballs."
"I have had ants in my car. A friend spilled a large sweet tea in the floorboard and I didn’t clean it well enough. Alas ants. I vacuumed them up and cleaned the floorboard with a portable carpet cleaner. No more ants, no more problems. Though I don’t know why the ants are attracted to the adhesive, I imagine they won’t be once the adhesive is cured. Also, it sounds like they are all on the outside of the car. As in not past the door jams so, it seems like a car wash would get rid of the pests after they do the ozone treatment. Also, since the manager said it has happened before it sounds like they know how to overcome the issue. I would not want to wait another how long for another new car that might have the same issue. Just me?"
"Before I would accept that car, I would want detailed information on: * the species of ants, * the brand and type of adhesive, * all of the places in the car where that adhesive is used, * the concentration of ozone and the duration, and * any disassembly or cleaning that they will do. Then, I would: * do some internet research on how these ants behave. Can they survive in my climate? Will they come back if the eggs hatch (maybe not if the ozone kills the queen)? * consider how accessible the locations where the adhesive is, so that I could determine if the dead ants could easily be cleaned out. * consider how the ozone may cause damage to other parts of the car. Knowing Tesla, they would probably be unwilling to give me nearly enough details to make me comfortable accepting the car, but I would ask anyway before sending it back."
"Ants attracted to an adhesive? I’ve never heard of this, how is this possible?"
Learn to say no
"WTF, LOL. I mean did they charge you extra for the ants?"
So will you constantly have ants because this adhesive is in your car?
🐜??? They seriously said it was an issue with Fremont cars 🤣
Ozone will kill everything in that car. Whether you accept that car based on that fact is up to you. But the ants will be gone
Theres a dude called Ian Miles Cheong who will give you a pretty penny for that ride! He LOVES ants!
The stack and a Leaf if I went EV.
I chose stack. 1300ozt+ & some gold/platinum.
The interior of those Tesla looks like a kindergarten designed it.
Stack. Teslas has less than 2 oz of silver and too much copper… Even my 20 year old diesel car has some platinum.
Probably a stack like this. I already have a car that I love anyways
That stack way before an EV for sure
Stack in a heartbeat
"Stack, always a stack"
I’ll take the stack
Stack Tesla is going out of business Reason: Congo
That stack
"I went to my LCS last week, and they said someone just came in and bought 1,500+ ounces of silver at once. Cleaned them out. Paid premiums on the unique stuff too. Intense stacking"
"That, is a stack 😳"
"Until Elon went on Twitter, I didnt realise how much of a ? (I cant think of the right word but it wouldnt be a complementary one) he is. I dont have the funds to buy a Tesla but if I did, I wouldnt, because of him. Id opt for another environmentally considerate vehicle or public transport. But a stack would be my preference. The shine, the clinking sound, the cool feel, the beautiful designs, and hopefully one day the value/worth!"
"I dont need to pay $30,000 for my stack to not be useless after 5 years, so Ill take that stack any day"
"Shouldn’t be either or, it should be both. If you can’t afford to have a stack like that. A model S is probably be too much."
Fire extinguisher included?
Which one will be worth more in 5 years? There’s your answer!!
I live in Texas and drive a 5.0L 370HP V8 4x4 F150 that is needed to haul my stack (through any terrain or conditions) - not to mention the 35 gallon tank gives me a 600+ mile range...no friggin EVs for me!
Stack 💯
A stack hands down
Stack all day long.
"Hmmm stack of beautiful precious metals or a tin bucket that will drive me off a cliff, tough call there"
Sweet Jesus that’s a beautiful sight
Tesla stock.
Stack
"Im looking at like 1,000,000+ in the next few years... So the stack..."
There’s about ten million things I’d rather have than a Tesla haha
Stack. Teslas are garbage.
Your stack all day and twice on Sunday
A stack. Ill never buy a EV Not worth it for me But Id buy a ⅛ scale Telsa made of pure Silver
"I have both, so can you."
Companies like tesla are one of the biggest reasons I started stacking. So... Ill take the stack
I’d rather you get rid of all that plastic
Would I rather be financially stable or catch on fire? Tough choice!
"Stack and fuck mush, hes a tool"
Stack and a Tesla
Yes.
"When they bring EV’s down to about $15,000, yeah."
I vote both and have both.
I wouldn’t pay a penny to a Tesla car.
"Me too, got a plug in hybrid Ford escape last month, I love it"
Easy... a stack for sure.
Porsche 911 full of silver.
STACK.
Stack! Stack! Stack! Stack!
STACK
Awesome stack assuming this is a tiny portion of your wealth.
Stack
Tesla cars near but the fact that they consider them environmentally friendly is bullshit
I choose the stack all day!!
Very based stack.
"THIS stack in particular? Or my stack? If my stack, well I have 3ozt gold, 30ozt silver, 25ozt copper. Heck yeah, Id trade that in for a Tesla! (But I cant drive, so then Id sell the Tesla and exchange the money for a new and bigger stack! ;D) If you mean THIS stack though...heck no, Id take the stack! :D"
What do you do for a living? Besides being rich :)
Stack
A Model S is not an investment a stack is...
Stack all day.
Stack fs
Both!
Stack
Stack
Stack
"Ha get a Toyota, closest thing to an investment when buying a car."
Stack... no hesitation.
"Teslas are awesome but I actually thought my Bolt was a better value. For now, Id go with the stack. But I would love to have another model S or, even better, an X."
Stack the Tesla will devalue
Id take a single coin first tf
"This stack ? Need more gold, like x 4 and silver x 5."
I have both and I’d take the stack if I had to.
I’d rather have an empty shoebox than a Tesla
the one that doesnt explode
Stack absolutely but I would not pee on a few of those. 🤔
"Let’s see, a depreciating asset or security? Easy one for me."
Ill take either one if you are offering. Thanks so much.
"Stack, no contest."

Original article for the test: [ Scroll down for table of all cars tested this time around(they do this test every year with newest models to hit the norwegian market)
"Winter range is depending on one thing and one alone - are you starting from a garage and have you preheated. If I leave from my garage preheat the car I get 90%+ of my normal range down into single digits. I can make my drive and use 350 whr/mi If the car sits out all night, gets cold cold and then I try and drive I will lose 30-50% depending the length of the drive. Long drive, less loss. If I start a drive and the car is cold, I’m using 700-800 whr/mi for the first 15-20 mins, then trail off from there. The process of warming the battery and cabin is a massive power suck for the first 15-20 mins. Last week Friday it was 11* F, I left home with 235 miles (80%) to go to Ohare which is 50 miles away. Preheated the car while in the 50* garage. Arrived at the main parking ramp with 179 miles. Hardly any loss. I was away for 5 days, returned to the car with 179 miles. Warmed up the car while I was on the tram and lost 2 miles during that process. Left the ramp with 177 miles of range, it was 9* F … I drove my 50 miles home and had 67 miles left in range. Over 50% loss… probably excessive because I cranked the heat really high and drove 75mph."
Always amazed at what gets downvoted quickly. “More Tesla news?” “Not on my watch!” 👎
My 2023 S lost about 25% of a full charge Couldnt make 300 miles in 33-35f degree weather doing an average of 70 miles an hour.
Im going to wait for Teslabjorn to test it :)
"What kind of range does the Lucid get in winter? I guess it’s unknowable since they’ve hardly delivered any, and most of them are probably in places that simply never get cold…"
*Set new record among vehicles on hand for test. I imagine a Lucid may have beat it if they could have tested one.
Do they say what year model s? Read the article and they don’t specify and the video is in another language
Is there a complete list of all participating EVs and there goals?
"Its a pretty silly test, since the last part of the test goes up to over 1000 meters above sea level, and only those cars that have suficcient range to clear the mountain will be able to regenerate the range consumed to climb, thus giving them an artificially high lead over the rest. Of course, you need to give the Teslas credit for having that suficcient range, but bear in mind that the cars in the next places arent necessarily as far behind as you would assume from just looking at the total range in the test results, since many of them never got the chance to regenerate from climbing the mountain. So the results are real, but cannot be applied to anything other than that specific route driven in the test."
"You can get great range in cold weather if you: - inflate the tires to 60psi - turn off all heat and heated seats - turn off the radio, configurable sub safety systems, and anything that isnt necessary to driving - throw everything out of the trunk and drink - possibly lightweight the car (OEM / stock class drag strip and circuit course guys know who cheat a little know what I mean) Basically do EVERYTHING that a normal use case drive would never do in an every day scenario."
My 21 model 3 long range only got about 116 in the recent snow storm by me
Applying a defogger treatment to your windows will help drastically with range. You wont need to run the AC to defog the windshields.
Important EV test winter cold weather

"This happened to me the day I bought a brand new 2021 Model 3 Performance and was driving back from picking it up. I dont know how much of it was due to Teslas QA/reliability or the ""bathtub curve."" That entire day was pretty messed up as the tow truck driver damaged the window trim (pyro fuse blew and the 12v battery died in the process of it being broken down so the window didnt roll down when the door was opened). The tow truck driver also wasnt prepared to handle a completely dead Tesla and ended up dragging it onto the flatbed. What I do know is that after it was fixed (the 12v battery, pyro fuse, HV battery, and the trim replaced) it ran perfectly fine and I even took it on a 2700 mile road trip. I think what pissed me off the most was that Tesla had very little sympathy/empathy toward the situation despite just having purchased the thing. There were some other nitpicks and oddities (like finding out that the reason my tail lights werent flush was because Tesla failed to secure them). I eventually traded it in. At least I got $7000 more for it than I paid (this was at peak inflation/used car values)."
It’s his third Tesla. Zero sympathy.
The customer accepted the delivery so this is within specs.
"During one of my thousand visits to the Service Center, I spoke with the service advisor who had become a friend and he had quit and only had a few days left. (He was actually happy to see me so he could say goodbye!). Anyway, he told me the dirt and it was worse than even people in this sub know. Like, half of every car they sell has defects at delivery and they have to use a script to convince people to sign for the car with lots of promises he knew were lies. They body shop they use is backed up 6 months so youre not getting the damage fixed for a very long time, they dont have parts to fix those issues, and the techs have a ton of turnover so they have no idea what theyre doing and few techs have any real experience with Teslas. He worked at a plain Jane dealership before Tesla, like a Honda or Nissan or something, and said he couldnt remember a single time a car came in with damage unless it was something from a stupid transport driver or something. I have so many stories he told me, it was a gold mine."
"I love the reply ""Ive never seen this before..."". Oh? Really? Like that spate of Model 3 stopping in the road last summer? I guess you cant see if you dont look."

Interesting
Theres so many of these horror stories. If someone has $40k+ to pay for a car theyre better off buying a regular ICE car at this point at an entry level luxury price point.

What kind of issues?
Looking into it.
Just garbage. How can anyone buy these at this point?
">That’s really unfortunate. Never heard of that type of issue before. Hopefully it’s an easy resolution to get you back on the road hahaha, uh huh, yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
Sounds like it was within spec
Quality Control off the assembly line is on the decline.
Lemon law?
You just didnt know that Tesla car are those that get the worst rating on quality.
"But I am told that the cars are not a scam, because they are real physical objects delivered to a customer. Fucking morons."
Just make sure you signed the form that says you want sue them

"I dunno if I would call the interior feeling cheap, maybe minimal. I think some people think of them as luxury cars but they’re more like a jeep grand Cherokee or another high end domestic. I’m pretty sure you’ll like it. My wife was even on the fence and now she’s totally sold on it. It’s also super convenient to always have a full tank ready to go. I hope your move forward with it. It’s really great."
Had my model Y for a week and its the best car driving experience Ive had.
You had me in the first half
Same here. I rented one in San Diego for 3 days. Placed an order as soon as I got home in Colorado 😏 Now just waiting and waiting…
Cool
"Ive had one as a rental for 2 weeks for work, and I am pretty sold. Im still kinda bouncing between the Y and 3, But i do like the sitting higher and the ability to throw a lot of stuff in the rear. But I will have to wait a few years to afford the high front end cost. Edit-- Also want to mention I thought the car looked to basic and simple. but after driving 300 miles in 1 day. and then using it as a daily driver for 2 week. im beyond impressed with the auto pilot and the screen. When it rained so hard I couldnt see out the front window, the car drove itself more or less and i could see the cars around me."

Cars are not investment. It’s luxury. Enjoy your car!
Rented one from Hertz for a week and took it to Yosemite. Price drop 10 days later and a new MY in my driveway 6 days after that. Absolutely rent one. They’re awesome cars.
23 MYLR here with no rattles or squeaks. Austin build late Oct 2022.
"I was sold on the tech and driving experience immediately, but Im just not in love with the exterior designs and the use of space. Thats whats giving me pause, but I know its not going to change any time soon!"
“Investment”
So you ordered one without driving it and relied your opinion on what you may have read from the internet? You then test drove it and liked it? Cool.
"I am personally so tired of Oil changes Fluid transmission Gear box Belts fixing More oil leaks Switches braking Engine failure Gas up and down and up. Getting hacked at the gas station. So done. .

Think like this. We took 60 years to go from the Wright brothers-moon landing. Moores law is now faster than the predicated 18 months. Looking like 9 about now. It is worth the investment"
Good thing you didnt buy this as an investment in the summer of 2022. Would have been the worst investment of your life. Instant 20k depreciation.
Never understood the argument that Teslas interior feels cheap. Its on par if not better than all those German cars with useless plastic buttons and faux wood trims throughout. I would rather not having to pay for those.
"Dude, youre completely over-engineering your expectations. Its a good car. Go for another test drive if youre unsure."
If its expensive stick to a Prius. Youre the type of potential owner who will over extend then purchase every accessory and full ppf on a liability. Buy what you can afford its a commuter car.
You can do a test drive too
"We have a ‘23 YLR7 and a ‘21 Mach-E Premium RWD Extended Range. If I could combine the two it would be literally the perfect car. Have had the Y for a month and already needed to go in for service for a few days. The process went well, they took care of us and gave us an S for a loaner but still pretty annoyed that it had to go in. It basically sucks dirt from the outside into the cabin. The doors looked great but ended up being totally out of alignment and the door seals were bad from the factory. I still like the Y a lot. But they could do better."
"""interior looking boring"" is what majority of us think before getting one. You get used to it VERY QUICK and I must say after a year I fucking love the minimalistic interior. Its super futuristic and I think a lot of the cars in the future are going to start doing the same. I was driving through the desert at night (very dark btw) with the ambient lights off and it was truly an amazing experience."
"I dont find interior cheap; i find well build and practical. However, due to many moving part do not be surprised if you find a rattle occasionally."
Funny you brought this up cause I also rented a Tesla on Turo and live in LA. I rented a MY. Took a small road trip and enjoyed the vehicle. Only thing I wasn’t fond of was the road noise on the highway. But other than that I loved it. Autopilot worked flawlessly. It’s spacious and damn is it fun to drive. My delivery date is scheduled in March. Cheers!
Did you rent a 2023? I absolutely love my MYLR7. My only complaint is no Tesla Vision replacement for USS yet.
"As an engineer, this is excellent. Well done."
"FYI the EPA ratings include charging losses, so 290wh/mi is not what you would see in the car. The charging losses for a Model 3 are typically 14% in the EPA ratings, so the 290wh/mi rating would show up as 250 wh/mi according to the cars consumption metrics. You are only slightly beating or matching the EPA ratings when temperatures are above 65F. You should fix your graph."
"So, looks like Hawaii is pretty close to the perfect location for Teslas."
"Excellent work, matches my less carefully documented experience"
"This is a great rundown. However, my experience in Canada is very different, I have an LFP pack model 3 RWD and lost as much as 60% of my summer range when it was very cold (below - 30c). My efficiency was sometimes 600+wh/km."
This is fantastic data!
Nice data. We’ve had a couple days in the 50s and already seeing a big improvement and close to hitting rated Wh/mi. Looking forward to spring and summer.
"Solid estimated savings vs ICE gas, too. Over this period, what kind of maintenance costs did you incur? Anything else to share other? Regardless, Good stuff man!"

This was when musk became muskenburg. Also bringing cars back is good then elon can make them better whats the point here?
"So what you are saying is that Tesla has gone too WOKE? Lefty loosey, righty tighty. Elon is not going to be happy when he finds out about this."
"No, but you can buy the acceleration boost which comes closer than the vanilla."
I read here that installing a spoiler and adding stickers will bump up your HP.
No you can not. The performance has different motor and will beat the long range by .6sec 0-60 even with the acceleration boost. You also get the performance suspension.
"Getting the MYP from the get go will be cheaper. The Uberturbine, CF spoiler, and adding the performance boost will already surpass the price difference between the two models. You still got the brakes/calipers, suspension, offset, track mode, etc."
"SOMETIMES, the LR comes with the same motor as performance, but is software derated. There’s a company that sells a special harness to “unlock” more power, should you have the correct motors. "
"You can make it P-ish. Acceleration boost, spoiler, paint calipers red. That would only run you a couple grand extra. If you want and can afford one, just get the P."
Buy a spoiler and the brake cover pads. All done ✅
"Thatd be the ideal for me. I switched one order from a LR to a P, then I got to test drive the P and knew it wouldnt work for me. Im not a car guy (at all), so the whole faux-racing aesthetic of the P made no sense. In a perfect world, Id have elements of both, and the best way to do that would be to start with the LR and go from there. My initial plan was initially to keep the P, bin the 21"" wheels, find a way to remove that little spoiler, then raise the car back up again. In the end, it didnt seem right to buy a crazy-expensive car only to have to ""fix"" some of the things I didnt like about it. And thats kind of where I sit with the brand overall: love the tech and the ride, but Im just not fully on-board with the designs."
I got a set of Ubers for sale if you want to look the part!
"Yes, you can trade in the LR for the Performance"
I have a mobile connector and works great with the Nema 14-50 outlet.
Install it. It works great
"I returned mine, took a little while but got 100% refund. As long as it’s new condition they should refund 100%"
While I have not accepted delivery yet I have installed a wall charger. I did this based off recommendations from friends who own Teslas. It is a convenience of not unplugging and storing the cable every day you “may” need a charge.
Just look at the return policy. Hopefully you have not opened it so you can get a full refund and not get charged restocking fee. [ I used to work in returns logistics for one of the big US wireless carriers and most people dont realize how costly returns are to vendors... that was an 8 digit cost for the carrier to maintain all of that return infrastructure (shipping cost and cost of return).
"Remember, a 14-50 (mobile connector would use this) has an extra conductor (2 hots, neutral, ground) compared to a Wall Connector which only needs 2 hots and a ground. 6/2 cable is much cheaper than 6/3. If you have a long length, the wall connector will save you money. For me, I needed around 100ft of cable, which saved me around $200 running 6/2 instead of 6/3. Keep in mind that I did all the work myself. With an installer, you’ll likely save more than just $200. Ontop of that, you can get 48amp charging (11kw)."
"Returns are pretty easy, but slow. Returned my TPMS (because it was way cheaper on eBay) and it took a couple weeks to process even though they got it within days. 100% refund though. You can drop it off at a service center too, but that just helps with it being received faster. The return still gets processed at their usual slow speed."
"Honestly, the Wall Connector is fantastic. Havent used the mobile charger because the wall connector is so much easy to use"
I installed mine before delivery and the idea of being able to go from 5% to 90% in 4-5 hours is huge a benefit
"If you using 220v, make sure you have the highest quality receptacle possible. The cheap home depot receptables are simply not designed to draw large currents for several hours year round."
Def wall connector. It’s works so much better and convenient. I kept my mobile connector and just leave it in the frunk for emergencies.
how much do you plan on driving it on a daily basis? The mobile charger is not a practical solution if you’ll be driving more than 50-60 miles a day. It charges very slowly at about 4 mph. A full night charge will only give you like mayyyybee 50 miles if you keep it plugged in for 12 hrs straight
"Tesla customer service is awful. You could request a return and if they don’t honor it, challenge using your credit card and sell it on eBay. Then get the mobile connector."
"Tesla may accept your return, but just so your aware both those chargers charge at extremely different rates. Wall charger tops out at 5-6 hours for a full charge from 0%, while the mobile charger would take over a day or or 11 to 12 hours with a NEMA connection and appropriate amps. There are other variables, but a 60amp wall connection will get 44 miles an hour charge Tesla States. So if you drive more in an average day than you can charge, you would net a loss in available range."
"I returned a wall connector during the waiting game and they took longer than I expected to issue a refund, to the extent that I did a chargeback through chase to get my money back."
"I ordered wall-charger too and waiting for MY delivery, with the fear of crossing 60 days return policy, I returned it. They said refund will be issued in a week and exactly in 7 days got the refund from the date of receipt."
"Both work fine but if you already have it just keep it and enjoy the faster speeds, yeah not too much difference if you have all night to charge but sometimes you just want to top up after work before you go out at night and the extra speed is very handy. To each their own but I always recommend the wall charger at home and a mobile always with you in the car just in case. It’s come in handy for me on those random nights you need just a little help while you’re out and about without a dedicated charger nearby"
We have been using our mobile connector on a 110V outlet only to charge. Our mileage is around 1200 miles/month and mobile connector with free charging at work is enough for my daily rountrip commute of 54 miles. For longer trips we plan just a bit and havent needed supercharger top ups yet but that is also a backup option. You could get a nema 14-50 installed and use the mobile connector instead of the dedicated wall connector. Charge speeds arent that drastically different from a wall connector and you could potentially share your outlet for guest EVs. Depending on your need a Tesla wall connector or nema 14-50 outlet might be needed but we couldnt justify the cost of 1000$+ install since our panel is not in garage.
The TWC is still one of the cheaper EVSE options unless you can get a cheaper one installed through incentives with your utility provider. What is the reason you were wanting to return it in favor for the UMC?
if you dont have the recepticle for the mobile connector might as well keep the wall connector install cost will be similar and you can charge faster. I bought the mobile connector anyways so I have one in case I need it.
Mobile Charger tip…get the one in a clear plastic bag without the nylon case. $185 only! Ask the rep for it because it’s not on display.
I LOVE my wall connector.
The return information is literally in your confirmation email and on the order page. !!!!!! Wwwwwwwtttfff
I just did this. You can get a return label sent to you from your order history on the website I found out my utility company will give me a charger and reduced rate for $16/month
"Return it. Install commercial-grade NEMA 14-50 on a 50amp GFCI breaker. Now, anyone can charge any electric car quickly. Someone (think future owner) could even switch out the breaker and use it for a welder or the like if they wanted."
"Yes I have a 2020 Model Y Performance I have the wall charger and the mobile charger, I would advise just to use the mobile charger just get the 220V adapter and install the 220V outlet or if you have a 220V drier you can use that. It’s chipper and it works the same as a wall charger."

Tesla model why?

"Wait, I thought I could use my Tesla as a boat? Elon!"
"Soak it in a bag of rice before you turn it on, will be just like new!"
"Its ok, Teslas, like all cars, can temporarily function as a boat. You cant use it again after, of course, but for those brief few moments it totally worked"
It’s a Model 3. Back windows do not have factory tinted glass.
Can someone explain why are people so hellbent on specifying the model of the tesla anytime its mentioned? Just say tesla. No one cares what model it is.

Thats insanely dangerous for recovery. We had a guy a couple years ago back too far down the boat ramp. Everything was fine until they pulled it out of the water. Lithium + salt water = horrific metals fire. The FD had to just let it burn. 
"“It can’t mean that, there’s a lake there; this is the lake!”"
"To be fair, they did drive it on the beach. It was the ocean that gave them problems."
"OP, bad parking posts arent allowed.."
Did they put it in car wash mode at least….
Thats gonna affect the resale value just a titch
"At the beach, there is the part with the sand and the part with the water. You can drive a tesla on the part with the sand but not on the part with the water, at least, not very far. :-) For the life of me I dont understand how a person gets in this mess unless it is getting caught by the incoming tides as landlubbers are often unaware of the risk associate with the tide coming in."
At no point while lost have I ever thought driving super close or into water was going to help me.
Thatll be fine after you put it in rice overnight.
"Teslas submerged in that much water during hurricane Ian in Florida last month pretty much all caught on fire. Lots of pictures on the news. The batteries used in the Tesla react violently to water. Youd think that for that kind of money, Tesla would figure out how to seal the battery compartments better. But at least Lying Elon then posted that his new truck would float for a while in calm waters. Then one of the design engineers posted that floating was never part of the spec, and the truck would sink like a stone. Then Elon deleted the Tweet. Just a fucking psycho."
"Since it’s an electrical car, can they put it in a bag of rice???"

Great. Another thing polluting the ocean.
Oregon?
This just takes out the middle man and just throws the old batteries into the ocean yourself
Electric car batteries LOVE saltwater
Those batteries waterproof? Seems like a very dangerous situation.
I wonder how dangerous it is to be in the water with a 400 Volt battary.

"Micheal Scott must have been driving, I bet Dwight was upset."
I think Elon said they drive on water
This is a lifestyle. This is an Eddy Bauer Edition.
Naw theyre not lost. Theyre just on their way to Atlantis
I think that might be bad for the battery.
It should have even more electrical connections thanks to salt water...

I bet they were shocked when the tide came in
"Oh look, a salt battery"
Biggest car battery ever tossed in the ocean
They are just disposing of the battery the way you’re supposed to
That lower of center of gravity could not have helped here
At that point I wouldn’t even try to get out. I would just accept my whole life has lead me to this one stupid mistake and be content with my fate.

No no just keep going. I’m sure the water is wrong
"It does not float. Therefore, not a witch"

This the time of the year they return to the sea to lay their eggs. Apparently OP knows nothing about cars.
Might get really interesting when the salt water gets into the lithium batteries.

Gonna have to put that in a bag of rice
"Thats not on the beach, thats in the ocean...."
My 2.5 ton SUV on skinny street tires will handle this loose shifty sand NO PROBLEM.
That Tesla is now a hazard for fire believe it or not. Being submerged like that is not good for the batteries (lithium and water are VERY volatile) and has a high probability of catching fire in the future. Yep that car is nothing but trash now
"Woah, first dog mode and now boat mode??? such innovation OR Pet mode doesnt include fish!?!?!?"

Tesla Model Why
"Up for sale is a slightly used, low mile Tesla Model Y! Has a natural ocean fragrance on the interior to match its blissful white paint job. Barely used and ran last time it was parked! Looking for $75,000 obo but please, no low ballers. I know what I have. Also, no tire kickers. Test drives will not be allowed."

Well at least he found a way to prevent his Tesla from catching fire
The most aware Tesla driver.
"Believe it or not, this driver has an above average IQ than your typical Tesla driver. Doesn’t mean much tho."
To be fair....Elon does say these cars can float The owner should sue him and claim the car didnt live up to the promises of the OEM. If Elon wants to keep saying stupid shit on Twitter then he will have to face the consequences of all the people who arent smart enough to see how dumb the guys really is.
"Ouch, That Salt Water on the electronics will practically total this car."
It’s not just hoverboards that don’t work on water.
Whenever I take a wrong turn I look for the nearest beach to help me get back on track
But they still have a Twitter account.

At least when it bursts into flames it will already be submerged under water so it can burn safely for a few days.
Looks like a model 3 - rear windows are not tinted. Plus the tailgate is shorter than the Y. But who cares about details
"Must be a Model U, for underwater. They paid $12k for that submarine feature, and any day now, theyll get it working 100%."
Batteries will probably catch on fire after they fish it out due to the salt water corrosion.
Blame it on the auto drive navigation. Win.
Not good.
I bet the GPS told them to head straight.

">The NVH and suspension are unacceptable!!!!! Why isnt this talked about more??? I like my Model 3 for a lot of reasons and the value it offers as my work vehicle and racking up tons of miles, I can overlook some of the nitpicky things like diving through the controls for options that should be buttons or minimalistic interior and the quirks like the stalks, buttons, and phone/valet key are kind of nice once youre used to them. But the suspension is by far my biggest quarrel with these cars. The road noise, while prevalent, doesnt bother me too much (I had a stupid custom silverado i traded in for the Tesla, with a lift and mud 35"" tires... if you wanna talk about rough ride and deafening road noise🤣). But any kind of bumpy road or iterations in the road its like the suspension turns into plywood. Even though I find the seats pretty comfortable theres not much that can absorb that. Its to the point that my C8 was suposed to be my play toy car, but its so much better of a road trip GT car and better ride quality the Tesla gets left at home and my whole premise of owning it is the value proposition of owning it for racking up mileage and spending less. For anyone Ive met, or ever talked to that was between justifying the price difference for something like a used S S or a 3, I would 100% recommend a used S just out of sheer ride confort with the adaptive suspension. Myself Im considering getting a 20 Model S with the Raven suspension (or wait for the Plaids to keep dropping) out of the sheer fact I dont want to feel my spine rattling anymore. 🤣 Great write up though! All of the points you hit on are most definitely on par with a lot of sentiments with owning one long-term!"
"How many miles were on it and what kind of tires? I rent from Avis and I’ve noticed their cars have more and more miles on them, like instead of 10-20k I’m seeing 30-50k+. As they get more miles they are forced to replace tires on one axle because they never rotate them so Avis buys the absolute cheapest shit they can. I’ve had some cars with 4 different brands of tire."
"Can confirm on the NVH. It’s even worse in the backseats. I’ve ridden in my friend’s model 3 and several UBER drivers’ model 3s, and every single one was so loud at highway speeds. It was louder than a Honda Civic and almost as loud as a Jeep Wrangler. Kinda crazy for an expensive car."
"For some amount of time, Tesla was struggling with sourcing components from their suppliers. Somewhat of a ""parts bin"" situation. Teslas within the same model year might have different suspension components, etc. We had two Teslas, same year same trim at work for testing. Couldnt really use both for testing because one was louder and one had tighter steering and suspension. Fing blast to race around a flooded autocross track though! That computer makes you feel like a hero and the power makes straightaways not so long."
"Once you get past the initial wow of the minimalist interior and iPad aesthetic, you start to notice all this. The avg Tesla customer doesnt because they are not car people. But the rest of us notice the mediocre NVH, narrow and unsupportive rear seats, build quality issues, cheap feeling pleather, and overall lack of high end appointments."
"There’s a Woodmans in Kenosha with a couple dozen superchargers that would have added like 3 minutes of extra drive time to the trip. It’s too late for you, but if anyone is driving between Milwaukee and Chicago it literally could not be in a more convenient place to charge."
"Yup. Rented one in California for a week. notable likes: amazing acceleration, google like maps and nav, and driver assistance (auto Pilot and cameras) Most notable dislikes: User interface, loud interior, and comfort. Hertz: Had I not been with colleagues who had rented in the past, I would not have known about the minimum charge level that they would have happily dinged me with."
Suspension IS stupid harsh on OEM (or higher) tire pressures. Lower those to 35ish psi and itd be pretty normal sporty-ish ride. Still somewhat overdamped tho. The noise is pretty surface-dependent. It would be very quiet or pretty noisy. Never had issues listening to podcasts doing 80-90mph tho.
"OP, I was literally thinking about doing the same thing this summer and thank you for this info. I am also going to Chicago for a convention and was going to visit my sister in law in Milwaukee. I was thinking about renting a Tesla because the price isn’t much worse than the economy. I’ll just rent something more comfortable as you reminded me of the road situation in Chicago."
"When I rented a Model 3 from AVIS in Austin (October 2022) it was free to charge at any Tesla superchargers, and they let me know this when I rented. My hotel also had free charging, but it was a universal slow charger. There were also several other free charging options around the city at retailers, garages, etc… I did not spend, nor was I charged for fuel. I did have to return at least 70% charged or they would charge a fee (so I was told). The rest of your experience was pretty similar to mine."
"I live in Chicago. When I bought my Audi I had them ""downgrade"" the wheels to a smaller size to get more sidewall for the bumby ass roads. And I still feel relief when its winter and Im on the softer snow tires. I cant imagine how bad a 3 with the suspension you describe would be."
"Also rented a TM3 through Hertz recently and did some long distancing driving. My experience matches your pretty much. But right now they’re going for a helluva deal that’s unbeatable. If I were in the market, it would be the first car on my shortlist."
"So, I daily a V60 and just recently borrowed a friends Model 3 to go from Corpus Christi TX to DFW airport and back. Suspension really didnt bother me, and road noise was really only noticeable because theres zero engine noise to counteract it. Definitely wasnt a distraction or anything. The screen is fine after a day or two once you get things set. 90% of stuff in there you access once and its saved to your profile. Superchargers are everywhere, and on the 900 mile round trip, I had to charge 7 times for 15-20 minutes each time. Most of those were combined with meals, so I maybe added an hour to the whole trip. Gas in my V60 would have cost about $150 for the trip, superchargers cost me $80. Im 58"", 180lbs and while it wasnt Volvo comfortable, it was perfectly acceptable. Autopilot had the occasional hiccup, but I would say 95-99% of the time it was flawless. The most relaxing time Ive had doing that trip. After spending a week with it, were ordering a Model Y."
"Every time my Uber/Lyft ride is a Model 3, I have to mentally and physically prepare myself for how bad of a ride it’s gonna be. That ride quality is no joke."
Got a Model 3 through Hertz a few weeks ago because it was the cheapest rental they had. After two days I couldnt wait to return it. Absolutely hated that car.
Charging at home is really cheap tho
"Having driven 40k miles in a model 3 some of what you’ve written is accurate, some is because you had it for 20 minutes and some of it is simply subjective. It’s not a perfect car but in many ways it feels like you just wanted to hate on a Tesla and spent the money to confirm your suspicions. And, no, I’m not a non-car guy. I love cars, driven most everything on the road and love many types of cars for different reasons."
"Lol, the swirls and scratches are because its a rental car, not because its a Tesla."
"i test drove a model 3 lr and it honestly blew my mind. I agree with the statement about autopilot - it felt incomplete. However, coming from a 370z the road noise was insanely minimal, suspension was comfortable, the seat felt as if i was sitting on a cloud, and the acceleration is really hard to wrap your head around. Also… regen braking. Amazing. I’m now selling my Z and getting a Model 3 Performance."
I thought Im the only one who finds the Model 3 very noisy at/above 70mph. With an ICE car you literally dont hear the engine at 70mph so its generally quieter.
Teslas have worse build quality than economy car Hyundais. Most people who buy the lower end models are trying to compensate for failing at life.
Tesla makes terrible cars. Full stop. People buy them as status symbols or to greenwash. Nothing more.
"Hertz brought (or channel stuffed?) a crap ton of Teslas and the fact theyre renting them at near economy car level prices should be raising alarms not only to Tesla but also to Hertz, both of which are publicly traded companies. One of them is already taking massive losses however... I never rented from Hertz since I work at a major rival rental company, but I did have seat time behind a MY21 Model 3 SR+ during my days as an employee at a luxury brand dealership. Said car was very low mileage (<10,000km IIRC) unit which the former owner was fed up with the unreliability and trashy build quality and traded it in when used car prices let him walk away with equity. The summary while not as much in the long distance driving department mirrors yours in its very bumpy ride and harsh NVH. These are VERY cheaply built and thrown together cars and it shows in every corner you look at, far beyond the panel gaps the size of your hand. The biggest reason why these issues never are brought up is the same reason why TSLA trades higher than pretty much the next 10 major automotive manufacturers combined in market value - it is a full cult brand, even moreso than Apple. Before the past year, every single negative post regarding Tesla gets you targeted by fanatics, and while its narcissist of a CEO has finally shown his true colors and common consensus has turned on him, places like r/electricvehicles and heck this sub still has Tesla diehards who will go after you should you dare criticize their brand. Now in 2023 there are so many new and upcoming choices in EVs, you have to be real ignorant to pick a Tesla over anything else."
"I’m willing to bet you didn’t have a 2022 or newer Model 3? Suspension, NVH, steering wheel controls, build quality, and interior have all been updated. The difference between a 2018-2020 model 3 and answer one is relatively substantial considering most would just think it’s the same car."
"Careful, OP... youll draw the Ire of the Stans. Probably the worst thing in the world for tesla is their cars getting rented by normal car buyers. They get a firsthand account of how horrible the cars are with zero commitment to buy one. Imagine going on vacation somewhere youre not familiar & having to spend valuable time learning all the nuances of driving/managing a tesla that OP mentioned, and being rewarded with a crapcan that drives like a buckboard & is louder than a typical ICE sedan."
"Why is it that whenever I see one of these things pop up, it seems like theres an entirely different problem? Its like Tesla tailors their problems to each individual customer/potential renter."
"This is a great, well thought out review. Looked at several Tesla models but wound up buying a GV80. Couldn’t bring myself to pay the EV premium when I could get so much more in an IC Genesis and it does considerably better on gas than the posted EPA mileage. Someday an EV but just not there yet."
"I checked out the Tesla Model 3 when I was just cross shopping for a luxury sedan. Definitely impressive acceleration, but it in no way justifies the cost. I ended up an Integra that blows it out of the water in all categories but acceleration, and it’s a much cheaper car. Tesla Model 3 RWD should be 30k before tax credits and then it might be a more interesting value. Also, the model 3 RWD sound system is the worst I’ve heard. The other models get an upgrade."
"Superb post. Thanks for sharing this. OP try posting this in Tesla motors. The fan boys and the mods will ban you for saying anything negative about Musk or about the car! Soup nazis of the Musk variety they are 🙄 Id be interested in long term reviews of people too like 1,3, 5,7 years etc. How the interior holds up. Paint, squeaks etc and other issues if any. If they are the Toyota of the ev world as far as reliability is concerned despite the rattles and anesthetics not upto par. Is the model Y better in build and noise insulation?"
"I have a 2022 3LR, prior to I had a diesel pickup. The first month or two was just horrible in the Tesla due to lack of knobs/controls. A year later, I prefer it to a cluttered dashboard. It definitely has great acceleration and I think it rides well, but considering my last had 35s and a lift, not sure that’s a good comparison. But hands down, what I love best is $80/electric charge vs $600/mo fuel. Also Tesla supercharger network is phenomenal, the other networks can be hit or miss, but a Tesla charger is rarely broken. When you supercharge a Tesla you pull in, open charge door, plug in and that’s it. Other networks you have to jack with some app download, setting up another account, sometimes doesn’t connect or the charger itself won’t stay going, they are just a real mess. As long as fuel stays high and electricity stays reasonable, EVs make sense for commuting."

"Looking up the curb weight of Tesla model 3 and S are much heavier because of the battery, and the fact that they both of the cab forward design would contribute to cabin noise. Plus if the build has less sound dampening materials, and build quality of each unit built. Since tesla is a new comer to mass product what takes time to refine. Look at the cars we drove from the 1980s and 90s compared to today from the mass producers today you will a big difference. My wife had a 2001 Intrepid which is a cab forward design of the modern era , it had road noise more than other cars of its class. But the best test for any individual is to drive it long distance to see if you like it doesnt matter make model or brand I know because I used to work in car rental industry and have driven lots of long distance driving in many types and models."
Car enthusiast who majority of drive race cars complain about road noise.
"It was a Rental and you werent given proper instruction of how to operate all of the vehicle features. Drive one off the lot / showroom floor after being instructed on all of the features and their operation, then give an assessment."
Next time a Tesla is alongside me Im gonna indicate and turn slightly closer to it just to see if I can make it lurch to the side. Heehee
That’s too long to read I’m not reading it but. Gang gang gang gang and a nose rang

"Suspension could simply be contributed to the low profile tires. I test drive a Escalade with them was horrible years ago. As far as road noise that’s a big no go for me, I rent a ton of cars and drives me absolutely crazy how much noise some of them make on the highways and your right it’s rarely discussed on any car reviews, hence why I love german cars like vw they are super quiet and smooth. Good review btw!"
"I’m currently driving one as well, courtesy from Hertz. I think I’m paying 65 a day? Not bad for me considering a Chevy Spark or Nissan Versa shitbucket is 55 a day. I wanted a Genesis sedan but those were renting for something insane like 115 a day… fuck that. I was also given a fairly beat up Model 3. It’s a 2022 with 4800 miles and holy hell are the passenger side curbed. No dents or anything but the windows are scratched, swirls for days, no floor mats, and it was given to me dirty as fuck, and only 50 miles of range remaining. It’s ironic because Hertz demands you return it with 70% charge. Whatever, fuck you Hertz. I’m still driving it while my M235i is getting it’s front end replaced after a hit and ruin, no I didn’t hit anyone someone hit my car while it was parked. Anyways I’m really enjoying it, very smooth and effortless car to drive, and even in the highway my specific Model 3 isn’t too bad. The suspension is garbage I agree, feels like it’s broken or something. Steering on the other hand is direct and I like the weight of it. I don’t mind the screen, yeah it takes a bit to get used to but it’s much more intuitive to use than some of the other infotainments offerings out there right now. Once you set everything up in the controls tab it sticks, so I don’t mind it. It’s also almost instant to boot up unlike some Hondas or MINIs I’ve driven I live in Boston so it’s quite cold right now, and I’m noticing my battery isn’t lasting too long between driving and heating up the battery. I’m having to charge every other day or every two days, and every days is pushing it close. Charging itself isn’t bad as I just hit a supercharger on my way home from work, and the car lets me watch Netflix/YouTube while it charges, so I can’t complain. All in all I really like it, it’s a different experience compared to the cars I’ve owned (M235i, S2000, Cooper S), and it fits my life quite good. Would I get one? Not right now, but it’s on my radar now for next possible cars."
"The ride quality and NVH on older Model 3/Y is dogshit. ALLEGEDLY they have improved this very recently with new dampers, and better noise insulating glass etc but on my friends 2020 3 and my moms 2021 Y, holy fuck its bad. i did a quick measurement using my apple watch and it was over 6 db louder than my 2017 A4 (twice as loud since 6db means double) I was a rear seat passenger on a trip to NYC from Boston in my moms Y and its genuinely one of the worst rear seat experiences ive had and thats compared to multi hour rides in Kias, cars that cost half as much. I havent driven a newer production vehicle but if they cut the NVH and improved the suspension Id be pleased."
Were establishing a car company and this has been most useful. Ive sent it to my team. Thank you.
"Thank you so much for this write up. Ill be visiting Chicago in a few months and the Teslas are being advertised cheaper than a standard sedan through Hertz. I was tempted to reserve one, but after reading your post Ive changed my mind. Cheers!"
"Currently 2 days into a 4 day rental with a 2023 Model 3 which had less than 100 miles when I got it. First time driving an EV. The constant and instant torque is addicting and made me way more confident in merging in traffic. NVH is worse than my Outback, but similar to other ""economy"" sedans Ive rented recently. Interior materials / build is also similar to the premium ""leather"" trims on economy cars -- ex an EX-L Civic or whatnot. Maybe a step above with more soft-touch things. Ive learned to be OK with the infotainment. The cameras and such are fantastic for backing up and I like how well it senses the cars around me while driving. Also the built in maps are nearly as good as Google Maps IMHO. Biggest gripe is HVAC controls requiring a few presses. Honestly, my 2 biggest gripes are how over-reactive the auto-braking is -- Ive had the car aggressively brake when theres a oncoming car ahead turning across my lane a good 50 yards out and has plenty of time to clear and the Tesla thinks Im going to hit it or something. My Outbacks EyeSight would never brake that far out for such a quick blip The other thing is the lack of faster chargers. I looked on the EV charging app PlugShare and saw there were a few in the area Im staying. What I didnt realize is that they were only 6-7.2kWh chargers... Walking away for 30 minutes to go get some lunch and I assumed I would have gained 20-30% at least and was quite shocked to come back to only 5-6% gained. I had to go drive 8 miles away to the closest super charger to get back to 100% when I got down to 35% early today."
