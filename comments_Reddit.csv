 'Nope I love it,  even the pick up experience I had when I purchased it. Sounds like it‚Äôs just not for you. What I love about it‚Ä¶. \n\n1. Seats that just hug you so comfy\n2. Handling and the instant torque.. so much fun\n3. Green light alerts\n4. Car profile linked to me\n5. No car keys, just get in and go\n6. No car keys, park and get out\n7. No locking or unlocking car for its automatic \n8. Locking glove box\n9. Massive amounts of storage. \n10. Moon roof\n11. Climate hold to keep the AC/Heat on\n12. Tesla Charging network, no credit cards or payment machine\n13. Mobile phone app and it‚Äôs array of features\n14. etc‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.'
 ""I like how I can leave it running in the garage with the door closed and it doesn't kill my family""
 'Sounds like Tesla wasn‚Äôt the brand for you. What made you buy it? Did you test drive one before purchasing?'
 'Yeah, sounds like you‚Äôre on the mindset of having a bunch of buttons, clickity clack type car. As with any car, you have to get used to any interface except in this car, the interface is everything. Similarly, took a lot of people some time to get used to an iPhone touch screen coming from a blackberry with a full out physical keyboard'
 'Lmao what did I just read.'
 'Curious, what car did you or your family drive before the Y?'
 'You can use voice commands for most daily functions like ‚Äúnavigate home‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hot‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cold‚Äù ‚Äúopen trunk‚Äù.'
 'Floor it. Then you‚Äôll like it. üòÖ'
 'OP has no response since initial post. Just a trigger post.'
 ""You didn't like the buying experience? So you just miss the pagentry and pomp of being ground down by a slimy sales guy only to be abused and ripped off by the finance guy?""
 'If you thought the high price meant luxury that is where you went wrong. You‚Äôre not paying the luxury price for a luxury vehicle. You‚Äôre paying for the features and charging network which is leaps and bounds better than the competitors that‚Äôs about it.'
 'I love my 2022 performance Model Y. I had a Chevy Volt before. Even more after adding apple CarPlay in to center console screen & adding center usb-c which support data (music/game controllers) & power. Tesla should not have removed data ability in center console leaving only a data capable port in glovebox which is used by teslaCam.'
 'Looks like you are in the minority. Sell it and make someone else happy'
 'How old are you?  Your reaction is spot on for someone rapidly losing neuro-elasticity'
 'That\'s a bummer. Maybe it\'ll grow on you. There will definitely be a lot of snarky comments, but sounds like it\'s just not the car for you. Have you ever ""loved"" a car? I find that the process of picking gets you more emotionally invested in the inaminate object. The car buying process is hands-down the best when compared to traditional auto dealers. You don\'t have to sit through all the BS.'
 'I‚Äôm not sure what your expectations were, but it sounds like the car didn‚Äôt meet them. Is the car perfect? Definitely not, but in reality no car is. It may not be the right car for you or your family. \n\nConvenience and simplicity is a huge reason why many like it. No keys needed, no gas station to stop at, no oil changes, and does the job well. I enjoy the lack of engine noise and can sit in my car comfortably when in a parking spot.'
 'No need to convince you otherwise. I love the car. If you don‚Äôt, sorry you wasted your time and money. Hopefully you‚Äôll be able to test out your next future purchase'
 'Tesla‚Äôs aren‚Äôt for everyone. Sorry to hear about your experience.  I would recommend always doing your research and test driving any potential new car.'
 'Sell it then'
 'Um‚Ä¶ did you buy it blindly? Like, did you even go to a gallery to experience it in person before buying it? If not‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt know what to tell you lol'
 ""I love my MY. Except for the stupid elimination of parking sensors. \n\nA Tesla is the car equivalent of a smartphone. You get a high tech car. If that's what you enjoy, then you will be happy. \n\nIf you are looking for legacy car luxury, then it will be a poor fit for you. \n\nBut I'm surprised that you figured that out after spending $70k. Did you test drive before buying?""
 'I loved my wife‚Äôs model Y so much when she picked it up in January, that I put an order for another in February.  Now we don‚Äôt need to share lol.  Hopefully you all can sell it or learn to like it.'
 'From my experience the 3/Ys are not luxury cars. The S/X are more along those lines but also debatable. \n\nWhen the Model 3 was 40k it aligned well. Now the 3/Ys are so expensive. The price does not align with the features and luxury feel you can get from other cars at the same or cheaper price point.'
 '> The interface to do anything is kind of a pain in the neck. \n\nAgreed. I would prefer physical, tactile buttons for commonly used functions\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In the meantime, it does stupid things like a fart machine and a light show. I suppose it has to do something to keep you engaged with it.\n\n??? I\'ve never seen any of that\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Something about it feels utilitarian\n\nI LOVE utilitarian! I refer to it as my Transportation Utensil. I don\'t want to be ""engaged"" with my transportation utensil, I want it to be a reliable and useful tool'
 'The car might not be for people who are adverse to change. I‚Äôm anIT guy who loves just about anything that plugs in or runs on batteries, so I absolutely love it. But for people that are not into change or bleeding edge tech, it probably is somewhat of a let down.'
 'My MYLR is a company car. There‚Äôs a lot I miss about my BMW 530e that I‚Äôve had for 4 years but I fundamentally wanted a family full EV with loads of storage and range. There wasn‚Äôt much choice in the company car catalogue for full EVs. Had an iX or e-tron been available I think it would have been a more difficult decision. \n\nThings I miss about the 530e:\n- More comfortable suspension (despite feeling sporty and controlled in bends, it was a sublime ride compared to ‚Äò23 model Y). \n- Despite having an internal combustion engine, the BMW was much quieter in the cabin at speed on the motorways than the Tesla. \n- More comfortable seats (I think they were just bigger and plushy leather)\n- Leather everywhere\n- Wider inside (BMW was very wide, lots of shoulder space in the back even with a child car seat).\n- Parking sensors (don‚Äôt get me started)\n- Apple CarPlay (Apple Music on Tesla at least offers some consolation)\n- Could use cheap roof bar system from Halfords (Tesla roof bar is ¬£450!!!!)\n- Speed limit recognition is better on the BMW especially on the British ‚ÄúSmart Motorways‚Äù. \n\nHowever things which are great on the Tesla:\n- Full EV, goodbye weekly ¬£60 petrol tank refill. \n- Tesla Autopilot is far superior to BMW Driving Assistant Plus\n- SuperCharger network (probably the main reason I chose Tesla over any other EV)\n- in 4 years, not a single OTA update on the BMW especially to fix some CarPlay issues and Autopilot issues. In contrast I got a Tesla OTA update within 2 weeks of ownership. Let‚Äôs face it cars are gadgets as much as your phone is these days. The expectation is that gadgets get software updates and they get better and more features as time goes on. Tesla knows this. BMW does not. \n- Tesla at least considers RHD countries in its touch screen UI. BMW clearly forgot that some countries have the driver on the right. \n- Heated everything I.e. steering wheel and back seats (expensive options on the BMW)\n- Cameras everywhere (expensive option on the BMW)\n- Loads of storage (despite the lack of shoulder space in the back)\n- Flat rear foot well (no rear drive shaft/transmission tunnel)\n- Tow bar (was not even an option on the 530e)\n- kids love the glass roof\n- Keyless entry/phone key (expensive option on the BMW)\n- The touch screen on the Tesla is at least within arms reach. I don‚Äôt know who designed the BMW touch screen to be so far away from the driver but it was a stupid decision.'
 ""Best car purchase I've ever had! Didn't have to talk to a single person. Car was delivered to my driveway. Marked as delivered after the driver was already in the Uber on the way back to the lot. No small talk, no over anxious salesperson pushing the sale. I wouldnt wish a dealership experience on my worst enemy.""
 'Probably the husband is making her hate the car; so that she won‚Äôt take the car from him.'
 'It looks like you wanted a luxury vehicle with best in class battery charging experience and infrastructure. \n\nLuxury vehicle it ain‚Äôt, but it sure has a vastly superior infrastructure and charging capabilities vs its competitors.'
 ""It's a appliance/family compact SUV. I don't see why it would be very exciting, apart from straight line acceleration of course. The steering is quick and accurate but lack any response to grip level changes when driving hard, just like most modern appliance cars. It is however one of the least SUV driving SUVs out there.\n\nMine is my typical daily driver, Mon -Fri only, not touching it on the weekends. (This may very well change with track mode now)\n\nI do love the buying and delivery experience though, because I hate dealers with a passion.""
 'What car did you come from? Sounds like you want a BMW or Porsche'
 'Seems like OP is underwhelmed and disengaged in her own thread‚Ä¶also no back story or deeper insights on why for comparison‚Äî just a blatant lazy rant.'
 'I came from a Volvo and the interior is a little bit of a let down in comparison and less comfortable to drive but I absolutely love the car! Exceeded my expectations in most areas. The technology is amazing and keeps improving.'
 'Sell it !'
 'I like the car but customer service is by far the worst experience I‚Äôve had. And how do you complain about the autopilot that is the best thing for me for my long commute'
 '>It just feels like transportation.\n\nThis is part of what makes driving any Tesla wonderful in a metropolitan or urban environment, or places with lots of highway traffic. \n\nIt\'s absolutely not designed to be an exciting car. It\'s almost by definition a pretty boring car. \n\nIt does have everything I need, tons of space (front trunk, rear trunk, sub trunk, side trunks, rear seat fold down, deep center console storage, aftermarket storage bins that slide under the seats) and *absolutely* nothing you don\'t need. Super minimal by design, for both manufacturing and the ""vibe"". \n\nI like to call it my refrigerator on wheels, as it really is a lot more like an appliance than a conventional car. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe boring point A-point B of the thing makes it absolutely wonderful for monotonous drives through traffic. Stick it on autopilot, put some music on, and chill. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSounds like you bought the wrong car overall. I also don\'t blame you being underwhelmed at the current price point mainly on features and overall quality, but the driving experience really is sublime in the right environment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you live somewhere where there is zero traffic, zero traffic through long stretches or red lights and stop signs, etc, then yeah it\'s going to be a very unrewarding drive.'
 'I feel the exact opposite. The best car I‚Äôve ever owned. I‚Äôm impressed by the little things I find every day. I find excuses to drive and drive far. Two weeks away from owning the car for two months and I‚Äôm approaching 4000 miles. I‚Äôll crave something and just drive hundreds of miles to go eat it. I had to help my daughter put her car into the garage while she was away. Even driving up the driveway, I felt utterly disappointed in driving a gas vehicle again. Is it the EV part you don‚Äôt like or the minimalism?'
 'I agree with most of your points. Something about dishing out a large amount of money without getting the ""I feel good"" feeling. \n\nMy wife had the same experience. She was expecting a quieter ride, higher quality part feel, etc...  However, a month after learning all the benefits of the car, she would not allow us to purchase any other car than a Tesla. She\'s dead set on the Cyber Truck if it ever comes out. \n\nMy only advice is to give it some time and by time I mean weeks or even months for all the bells and whistles baked into the software to take full effect. As updates roll out, you\'ll start seeing the benefit of buying a car from a software company.'
 'I have had a Y since mid 2021 and an X Plaid since mid 2022. The X definitely has more of a fancy car feel than the Y. (Though at double the price, it‚Äôs still overpriced.).  Even just having the little screen in front of the driver makes it feel less like a toy car and a Disney ride.\n\nThe Y is a great commuter car. It has great safety features. Basic AutoPilot is excellent. The interior is undoubtedly spartan and utilitarian. No doubt. I also find that it lacks buttons for things better done with buttons. I usually engage AutoPilot as a safety measure when toying with the screen to do simple things that in the history of cars have been done better with buttons. \n\nYou will find little sympathy on this reddit thread. \n\nMost people who drive the Y have never experienced acceleration like an EV can provide. That runs over many other considerations all by itself. The passenger experience is ho-hum at best for a car that now typically runs near $70K. Please don‚Äôt get a third row in this thing, it‚Äôs a joke and a children‚Äôs deathtrap. \n\nA lot of things do feel cheap and easily damaged. The plastic trim around the seats easily breaks off a little plastic nub that holds it on and then it hangs loose‚Ä¶ this happens so easily and often people know the solution is just to thread a wire-tie through as a replacement.  Wiper fluid and rain have no channel or bump to guide slop away and god forbid you have the driver window open even a crack, you‚Äôll get soaked. No other vehicle I own has this concern. \n\nAnyway‚Ä¶ I have enjoyed the Y, but I have money to burn and didn‚Äôt want to refuel a gas car every other day when commuting. Being able to plug in (level2) at home is great. \n\nI look forward to competition taking away Tesla‚Äôs ability to ‚Äúremove‚Äù any more features, making these cars even more utilitarian. Already new 3/Y models are losing ultrasonic sensors. It‚Äôs ridiculous. They lost radar before I got mine, but USS loss is so much worse. Any cheapo car will have USS but your new $70K EV won‚Äôt. Horrible. \n\nAnywho‚Ä¶'
 'You should‚Äôve convinced your husband not buy it which is not a possible with Tesla ü¶æ'
 'some of y‚Äôalls feelings are for real hurt!  lol.  OP, mission accomplished'
 ""It's a car with really bright highlights (instant acceleration, phone key, remote access/schedule) and very obvious flaws (stupid auto wipers, cabin noise, subpar build quality). I got screen freeze, tailgate leak, door alignment issues in the first 1k miles. I like it because the highlights are more important to me. But it's not for everyone. What sucks is that there is so little real competition in US therefore Tesla can very much do whatever it wants without consequence (price increase over time, low build quality, bad service experience, etc.).""
 'You aren‚Äôt the right person for the car. If you are disappointed in simple interiors like it sounds like you are (cheap, utilitarian) then Tesla is the last car you should‚Äôve bought. \n\nI have an Audi who make arguably the best interiors in their class. Love the car but they can‚Äôt compete with Tesla on OTAs, acceleration, or simply being electric with range and a good charging network. To me all of that vastly outweighs the quality of the interior. I have three dogs as well so the interior is much more durable for that type of abuse. \n\nIf Tesla made a premium interior I would take it as long as it didn‚Äôt include real leather. But they don‚Äôt and it still remains the best option for me.'
 'Just think of the shoes you can buy with the fuel savings.'
 'Have you considered speaking to the manager?'
 'Replace MY with ""Elon"" and you sound like all his ex\'s.'
 ""It's poorly made by poorly paid non-union labour. As soon as the Detroit automakers ramp up EV production, it's game over for Tesla & Elon.""
 'What are you telling us for?' 'I bet you‚Äôre fun at parties'
 ""Sorry you're not feeling it. I definitely love my '23 MYP. Had it for a little over a month now and there are some minor annoyances (no car is perfect) but I think the good far outweighs the bad and I look forward to my morning commute more than ever. I live in an area with cold winters and I love how warm and cozy the car is when I get inside.\n\nMy biggest annoyances are kind of small. for one I don't like the way the wipers work. Auto wipers seem buggy and I wish there were a few levels below level 1.  something more intermittent. I think there is a lot of room for improvement there. \n\nI also don't like the way Spotify is implemented in the car. The sound quality is not very good and the app seems very stripped down versus the version on my phone. \n\nI hope that the car continues to improve via OTA updates. My minor gripes definitely don't take away from the fact that buying gas and getting oil changes are a thing of the past for me with this car.""
 'If I had anything to complain about the car, I would wish for the suspension to be a little better to smooth out the ride but I get it‚Äôs a performance car so tough to believe it‚Äôd be that smooth. Other than that, super fun car and impressed by the over the air updates and all of the other perks of driving a Tesla'
 ""I love my 2021 MY.  The only thing I do not like is the crazy price hike. Recently saw the 2023 Volvo EX90 and it has all the bells and whistles I wish the Model Y had for the same price point.    Note:  The advantage that Tesla has it's the supercharging network as of right now there is nothing better.  But once the competition like Electrify America and CCS catches up it will be a different story.""
 'I picked up mine last Monday and already put 1k miles on it. I feel the complete opposite. I love it and look forward to driving it. Interesting we feel completely different. I guess depends what you were driving before'
 'I love mine to the moon! No regrets.'
 'How someone could drive this car and not be blown away is beyond me.'
 'I absolutely love my 2022 myp the excitement I had when first picking up was something. Also I look for any opportunity to drive the car.'
 'Sorry but you sound older, 45+, and out of touch with technology \n\nYou‚Äôre using the interface for the first time, everything has a learning curve‚Ä¶\n\nWhy buy it if you don‚Äôt want to drive it?\n\nThis honestly sounds like a troll post, you‚Äôre not even responding to anyone'
 'I think a lot of people have such high expectations that they sometimes get let down like yourself. It‚Äôs not a luxury car even though it costs like it one. The entire process is streamlined taking away the hunt of finding your new car. Hopefully. You can learn to appreciate it for what it is rather than what you expected it to be.'
 'Tech in it finally feels like we are somewhere in 21st century. Sold my brand new Toyota RAV4 prime ( costs $50k) because the tech in it was so dated .  Autopilot, self-highway driving are the winner for me with the full panoramic glass roof and instant EV torque.'
 ""My wife said the same. During the first two weeks, I was even thinking about selling it as she complained almost every day. Now after two wlmonths, I'm barely allowed to drive the car üòÄ. She is not in love with the car but having preheated car every morning that's easy to drive and it's always ready to go (no need to go to the gas station)... But I have to admit I share her biggest complaint - nonexistent rear view. The rear window is too small, the rear camera gets dirty in a few kilometers in this weather and even though we still have USS it doesn't beep as we're used to it. Parking is...""
 'Reads like a troll account.  Saying you test drove a lot of them, still bought it, and now hate it doest sound like something people do.'
 ""It's definitely a car to test drive or maybe even rent.  It's very different in a way that some people are going to love and others aren't.  We rented one and my wife LOVED the interior and loved riding in it.  She wants the car more than I do and it's more for riding in it than driving it (which is kind of odd, I admit).  I liked it way more than I wanted or expected to and I think part of that was how different it was, but again, I can see someone having the exact opposite reaction and I'd totally get it.\n\nI'm sorry it's not the car for you, it must be a big bummer to get a hyped car only to be disappointed.  Hopefully you'll at least grow to like it more, but I'm skeptical that you'll ever love the car as I think your tastes just don't match what the car is.  I have a feeling an ev6 might have been the better choice here for you.""
 ""I went EV shopping today and checked out all the Teslas, and drove a couple. I've never been in one before, believe it or not. I was not impressed. There is no excuse to have such a low-quality interior. I checked out almost every EV I could find between 50-80k$. I was not impressed with the Y Model. We liked the Mercedes EVs and even the beamer. The range could have been better, though, and the lack of access to charging stations is a bust. We may have to wait for some of these new cars to enter the field this year. With cars like the Fisker Ocean and many others entering the EV field later this year(hopefully) with beautiful interiors and exteriors, advanced technology, and significantly better range, Tesla will have to start trying harder. The look of the car is stale and outdated, in my opinion. I personally lease cars because I like being in new cars with new tech. It feels great driving a beautiful car but to each their own. I spent 8 hours checking out multiple dealerships and even non-EVs. The interior of model Y was on par with low-end trims of sub $35k cars. (outside of the TV in the middle of the car)""
 ""Don't listen to all the fan boys here, you make a very valid point. It is an excellent car until you step into the cockpit. It feels and looks cheap, reminds me of an Ikea living room.""
 ""Tesla model Y is not a luxury car. With federal and state rebates the base model y AWD is around 42k before tax. Shop around and you can't find an AWD EV with acceleration in the 5s range for 0-60, etc. You will need to pay 10k more. For one who doesn't qualify for the rebates, there are lots of other options and it's worth test driving them all: Toyota BZ4X, Mustang Mach E, Ioniq 5, VW id.4""

I agree that the price is the main issue. Look I don‚Äôt expect a perfect car but the price itself does make me tend to look harder for flaws.\n\nSpeaking of mobile connector, i actually had my order in a few days before the cutoff day for free mobile connectors (April 27 i think). i know, lucky. But when i picked up the car the sales rep flat out refused to give me one when i said my order should have it. Even after i showed him Tesla‚Äôs own online store page clearly listing April 27, he was stunned for a few seconds, then proceeded to show me a internal email that says April 17 instead. I insisted that this was your own internal mistakes and asked for manager. The answer i got, which i remember vividly, is ‚Äúthe manager is in a meeting and no one is gonna honor this.‚Äù Mind you, this was a Saturday. The funny part is I later submitted a service ticket and got this issue resolved the next day. I still remember the guy‚Äôs face when i walked in and picked up my mobile connector. He clearly recognized me. I‚Äôm glad it was quickly resolved eventually but the arrogance of that sales team was insane.'
 'Enjoy, the M3 RWD is basically 90% of all the good features of a Tesla for 60% of the price of the Y.'
 'I\'ve had mine for a little over a year. The vehicle drives very well.. love the handling and love the performance (M3 LR - no performance upgrade). Pricing wasn\'t a big deal to me, especially compared to what dealerships are charging for other vehicles right now. But with the recent price increases, I would think it\'s overpriced at that cost as well.\n\nMy wife was extremely hesitant to drive the car in the beginning because she couldn\'t get used to it. She refused to, but when the gas prices skyrocketed, she finally gave in. Now, she loves the car.\n\nMy ""gripes"" (not necessarily about Tesla, but the complete experience):\n\n* Interior ""looks"" a little cheap for the price. Because the car is so simplistic (steering wheel and a screen), it just doesn\'t have the same look luxury cars with the same price point have.\n* I think it\'s stupid that you have to pay to unlock upgrades. If the car has the physical capability, why not include it. Hate that cars are going the way of the video game ""DLC"" route. With the LR, I\'m happy that the only upgrade is the performance boost, but if rear heated seats or premium sound was extra, I\'d be pretty upset. I refused to get a Toyota because of them doing this for the remote start and a lot of other car manufacturers are doing the same thing.\n* I am concerned about the life of the battery long term and the cost to eventually replace it.\n* Repair times - ugh. I have clients that also own Teslas. One of them told me that they were rear-ended by a vehicle owned by a TLC.. he went through his own insurance because dealing with the TLC insurance company is a huge headache, but he doesn\'t have rental car coverage. It\'s been 2 months and the car hasn\'t been fixed yet and he\'s been without a car this whole time.\n* Fuckin rims. Roads can be extremely narrow around where I live and there\'s not a lot of parking. Parallel parking is a necessary skill. And getting as close to the curb as possible is also recommended if you don\'t want to be hit. I can\'t believe how many times I\'ve scratched up the rims. \n* Driving long distances is a pain for EVs. I went up to Toronto (from NY) last winter and it was extremely nerve wracking between super chargers at times. It originally estimated that I\'d have 13% battery life remaining between my 2nd and 3rd charge.. I ended up with 1%. Charging also adds a bunch of time to your trip time too. My brother has a Mach E and we took separate cars for another trip to Canada. This time I took my minivan because I went up with my family. He left early in the afternoon from NJ and I left late in the evening from NYC. I ended up arriving at Niagara Falls before him despite him leaving half a day earlier. There were other delays like them stopping for food or stuff like that, but there was no way I should have arrived before them. Wasn\'t like I was driving extremely fast either because it was foggy out too. Would have loved the ability to use AP on the drive though.\n* Supercharging is really expensive. If you don\'t have access to a charger at home (or wherever you park), you probably shouldn\'t consider an EV.\n\nBut overall, I love the car and the benefits heavily outweigh the negatives.'
 'Thank you for your honest incite on why you got the M3. I agree with you üíØ!  I received my M3 last week and I still cannot stop grinning when I look at the car. It‚Äôs simply a work of art!  üòÇ'
 'Oh, I should add one more ""Ugly"". The Lack of USS before a reliable implementation of the camera based version.\n\nI\'m totally fine with them Removing USS if they had a viable alternative solution as I think the car looks a lot better without all those silly circles around the bumpers, but, I\'m very annoyed that they don\'t have a viable solution implemented BEFORE removing USS.\n\nIt\'s very annoying when parking in a tight garage to not have the USS or some sort of close distance warning. I\'m fine with the limitations of a vision based system, but have it available and ready BEFORE removing the USS!'
 'The odd thing about the chargers is that I ordered both the mobile charger and wall connector at the same time that I ordered my RWD a couple weeks ago.

It‚Äôs odd that mine arrived fairly quickly but I‚Äôm seeing so many posts about the long wait. Hopefully my car arrives quickly too!'

Both have similar mileage, and neither have given me any issues. I‚Äôve had my tyres replaced at Tesla after the original set wore out and they were entirely painless to deal with. There was also a small reflector that went missing at some point and a mobile ranger came out and replaced it for free. Can‚Äôt comment on expense to repair because nothing has broken that needed repairing in over three years and 74,000km of ownership.\n\nNeither car has ever left me at the side of the road other than when I got a puncture and had to wait for someone to come and help. I‚Äôve had that happen with ICE cars too so I wouldn‚Äôt count that against either EV. Reliability stats put EVs in an entirely different class. Reported reliability for Toyota is 85%, the LEAF is 99% and based on my experience with the Model 3 there‚Äôs no difference in reliability yet.'
 'We have a model 3 and an Audi Q4 etron. Only have had the etron about 2 weeks so not a ton of comparisons yet. \n\nRange and charging ease is better on the model 3.

 ""2018 Model 3 RWD: good car and I was so happy with it I got a 2022 Model Y as the second car. Had a few minor issues with the Model 3, never been stranded though.

Part catalog is online and heard mixed reports on parts, even the same part (like the fender) some get no problem while others say they won't sell it to them. The few out of warranty repairs have had done seemed fair (internal camera $380, 12v battery $120) and what they would have charged me for the other things weren't THAT bad (I think worse was rear window for $800, but it was an early flaw so free). \n\nI really like the ~30 buttons around the steering wheel and then things I hardly ever use while driving on the screen. I also like the lack of a display behind the steering wheel at night (wasn't sure when I got it, now that is a plus), but some cars you can turn it off and in the day I don't care. The main thing I don't like is the hip room from the cross support behind the seats when sleeping in the back (I liked to stay at RV to charge). I get used to the acceleration but it is still fun to feel after a long day, to each their own though. I hope to keep it for at least ~11 more years.\n\nSupercharger network is great but hopefully they will start adding CCS protocol and adapter so if that is your major reason just be ready if they do and you feel bad. They said end of last year but who knows when, if ever. If you change your mind post purchase in the past Tesla has had good resale value but the car shortage is easing up so don't expect to get full value, but historically it has been good.\n\nMy other BEV experience is 5 years with a 2013 Leaf (Model Y replaced) and drove a friends Mach-E for ~20 minutes. The Mach-E felt like a larger Leaf, I had to push a button to even start it. Traction control seemed a little slow but it did have a softer suspension (new Model 3 may have the updated suspension though) which may have been while it felt more like the Leaf. At the time it was like $50k for the Mach-E and $67k for the Y, I would consider the Mach-E with that price difference. I was deciding between the $30k Bolt and $55k Model Y but in the end if my family was in an accident I wanted to make sure I wouldn't feel guilty for cheeping out if I could afford it and road trips with a kid the Y is better than the 3 (and Bolt is not a good enough road trip car) but the 3 charges miles faster and I prefer driving it so if single I would pick the 3.\n\nAs always I recommend trying to test drive a couple brands, see what you like. Good luck and as long as you choose a BEV thank you.""
 'I started with a dual motor model 3 now have an S plaid.  When I got the model 3 it was the best car I ever owned. I commuted 130 miles 3x days per week and it was the best commuter car you could hope for. Super comfy seats, no engine noise/vibration, cheap to operate, and autopilot made highway driving easy. Would listen to podcasts and just relax. I did several cross country trips, one to glacier national park, TX, and more. Loved it. Great car. Mine was bulletproof, never had to do a thing other than wiper fluid.'
 ""If you are going used, you should be aware of the major milestones of the Model 3. Here is what I remember off the top of my head but maybe there is a better guide online somewhere\n\n* Prior to Mid-2019\n  * Seats where Gen 1 and much less comfortable\n  * There where known window controller issues - $300 out of warranty\n  * There where known charging port issues - $1800 out of warranty\n  * There were known camera problems - $300 out of warranty\n  * Autopilot wasn't standard and was a $4k option so be sure the car has that.\n  * For a short period they sold EAP so you might get that on a used car in this range.\n  * For most of first half of 2019 FSD was $3k or less\n  * Cars of this vintage come with homelink garage openers standard\n  * All these cars had HW2.5 FSD computer in them and the upgrade to HW3 is $2500 + the cost of the monthly service.  Might need this for autopilot in the future when they merge FSD driver into AutoPilot so it's worth thinking about but who knows.\n  * No CCS Adapter support\n* After to Mid-2020\n  * The interior console changed to matt black and was redesigned\n  * Added a power trunk\n  * Heating changed to a heat pump\n  * USB-C plugs\n* After December 2021\n  * AMD Ryzen infotainment upgrade""
 'This sub is unpredictable when a question is asked about Tesla... I am going to go grab a bag of pop corn now and will be back. \n\nBtw, it might be helpful to note where you live as CCS charging stations are more widely available in certain regions and countries.'
 ""There have been countless times where I really appreciated the small features of the car, many of which are rarely mentioned in reviews.\n\n1) In general, everything feels tight and high quality. The quality issues in the early days no longer apply. \n<br>\n\n2) It's crazy that most new cars still don't have a wireless charging pad, let alone for 2 phones. While I always loved Android Auto in my Volt, there were a number of communications/cable issues that meant I have to drive without. Being able to just set your phone down and go is so satisfying. No messy cable. And no having to wait to launch the AA/CarPlay app when you sit down. \n\n\n3) Phone as key, and being able to grant/revoke guest access from the app. I went on a road trip in a full car this summer, and was able to give guest keys to everyone, then take away their aceess when the trip ended. I never used the key card. I had a key fob in my Volt, but this is 100x easier. No need to pass someone your fob if they need to run out to the car to grab something.\n\n\n4) Level 2 charging at home is practically a requirement, even though the Supercharger network is incredible. It is just too easy and cheap. I went all out and purchased the adapter kit, but have yet to use it. The 358 mile range on the LR is something all EV doubters should experience. Btw, there are a number of places that non-Teslas still can't travel to. (I'm looking at you, Yellowstone.)\n\n5) The app in general. Everything just works, and doesnt require a subscription like with OnStar or have a trial period. I can make the car fart in the quick menu, but I can also adjust the climate settings from the backseat. \n\nI know you only asked for 1, but there's just too many! Thanks for coming to my TED talk.\n\nP.S.: supercharge.info has a running list of all the new sites going up. It's insane how there are new sites going up 7 days a week.""
 '2023 Model 3 RWD, about 1k miles in. I\'ve driven a \'21 Mach E Premium, \'22 ID4 Pro S, \'23 BMW i4 M40, and \'23 Polestar 2, and a \'20 (previous gen) Model 3 Performance.\n\nThe \'23 Model 3 is a good car. I have had a poor experience with delivery and service, but from a pure driver\'s experience, it\'s quite good. \n\nPros\n\n- Enjoyable to drive: good performance, steering, and regen braking\n\n- Driver profiles: if you have ANYONE else driving your car this is a godsend. Seat/steering wheel memory, regen braking settings, mirrors, etc. It\'s amazing.\n\n- Actual usable Nav: Not a big deal in ICE cars with Apple Carplay or Android Auto, but having to use built in nav to pre-condition the battery is a pain in poor nav software. Tesla wins here (but i still wish they had Carplay/AA)\n\n- Supercharger Network\n\n- Tesla App: Not perfect, but the best mobile app out there for your EV. Most importantly it\'s quite reliable. Even simple things like using phone as key just *works*. My friend with an Ioniq5 hates the app and has to carry his key fob with him because it isn\'t reliable.\n\n- Value (for the base model RWD): At just under $40k with the tax credit, the base model comes pretty much fully equipped minus a better sound system, some interior lighting, and fog lights. For comparison, the Polestar 2 base model doesn\'t come with a heat pump, pano roof, premium sound system, fog lights, HDA, or blind spot monitoring. BMW i4 doesn\'t come with HDA or parking assistance as standard either. Yes, you can add them but now they are in an entirely different price bracket.\n\n- OTA Updates: The recent holiday update gave Auto-Turn Signals which auto turns off your turn signal after making a lane change. A nice QOL adjustment from the S and X. Tesla has proven that they roll them out consistently and do make your ownership better. \n\n- Big modding community: Mods aren\'t for me, but a result of having such a big and developed modding community means that there is a wealth of information on how to take apart and put your car back together. Add on that the car itself is pretty simple to assemble, and it\'s not hard to do many small repairs or replacements yourself. For example, if you broke a tail light, you can order a part on ebay for like $100 and install it yourself pretty easily in 10 minutes.\n\nCons\n\n- Build quality: It\'s still a problem. Paint is soft and chips easily. Panel gaps are unavoidable. It\'s likely you\'ll encounter some rattles or unwanted noises in your car. I\'ve already been to the service center 3 times within my first month of ownership. I have a mobile appointment set up for a driver seat rattle next week. Service centers are hit or miss. Because of poor QC, you have tons of new owners clogging the centers because delivery team just gets them to accept and then go to SC. They are overworked and understaffed, and as a result SC quality is hit or miss. For me, it\'s been a miss.\n\n- Ride quality: New models are better (compared to the 2020 I drove), but it\'s still noisy inside. Suspension is stiff and the ride is rougher than most other EVs out there. Out of every non-Tesla EV I drove, this one is the second worst (\'20 M3P was the worst) Highly recommend getting 18"" wheels and adjusting PSI if your range permits.\n\n- No USS/Radar: Specific to 2023 models, but not having USS, or a working alternative, is unacceptable. Luckily, I never had parking sensors so I\'m used to not having them, but to remove them without an alternative ready is asinine.\n\n- While the software and UI is pretty good, I still wish I had physical buttons for certain things.\n\n- No Apple Carplay or Android Auto. Built in Nav is probably the best in the industry (minus Android Automotive), but I do prefer having Carplay up. As a result I have Waze on my phone on a mount even with Tesla Nav on the screen.\n\n- No hatchback: The Polestar 2 and I4 are both sedan-looking, but they have hatchback trunks. This makes loading and unloading the trunk so much easier (also side note: the Polestar hands free trunk access is SO GOOD. I really wish Tesla had this feature)\n\nOverall, I think the base RWD is a great value (with the tax credit). It\'s the best feature rich EV at its price point by a good margin. When looking at the Long Range or Performance, I think it\'s harder to justify, especially with the tax credit in limbo. I would not buy a LRM3 at $58k, or the Performance at $63k when you can get the RWD for $40k. At the $60k price bracket, the value just isn\'t there anymore. If the LR gets a price change to get under $55k for the tax credit, which I think is likely, then it\'s a good buy. For $8k more (compared to the RWD), you\'ll get AWD, longer range, more performance, and some minor features (fog lights, better sound system)'
 'Switched from a Model 3 to an F-150 Lightning.\n\nI miss the software, UI, and mostly the super charging network. The EA network is absolutely horrendous and that‚Äôs not an overstatement. I took a road trip from TX to CA it was a musician I made it.'
 'I was a both Model S and 3 owner and now drive the BMW i4. Model 3, IMHO, was a cheaply made car and relied on the Tesla infotainment to make up for quality manufacturing. Getting back to a BMW I realized what I was missing out and how awesome it feels to drive a quality product daily. Wouldn‚Äôt touch Tesla again'
 'My 0.02$‚Ä¶\n* Comparable to other premium cars as far as  repairs go (Audi , bmw etc). Bumper 1-2k , windshield 1k, door handle 200-300$\n\nEdit: Apparently cheapest luxury brand :\n\nhttps://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-is-the-cheapest-luxury-car-brand-to-maintain-according-to-new-study/\n\n* That being said there‚Äôs a lot less to fix comparatively\n* Better than any other car I‚Äôve owned in winter \n* updates 4yr into ownership just doesn‚Äôt exist anywhere else\n* cheaper fuel \n* Suspension rattles quickly into ownership (think ford explorer type degradation)\n* Tons of fun (geico piggy type of thing ‚Ä¶ we we weeeee!) \n* Slightly overpriced (awd at 40k with EAP would sell like hotcakes). Currently 53k pre-tax\n* would buy again (particularly if prices keep falling as they have in China )\n* EAP is good but FSD isn‚Äôt worth it to buy outright\n\nEdit: \nAs droid4ever said , not futzing with an app to charge is really nice (I‚Äôve used EA and ‚Ä¶ wow). As they said software is much higher quality with Tesla'
 ""Ive owned the more commons EVs before the last few years. Prius Prime, egolf, leaf, Ioniq EV. \n\nThe Model 3 was probably my favorite most balanced car I've ever had. The seats hurt my back though. It's very weird and I don't know anyone else who this happens to.""
 ""I can compare my 2015 BMW 335i to my 2021 Tesla 3 LR with AB. I run the same tires on both cars so it's a good comparison.\n\nThe Tesla is by far the best sport sedan I've ever driven. Cornering is extremely flat and balanced (the BMW was balanced but way too much body roll), steering feel is on par or better, steering accuracy is better, acceleration is obviously phenomenal. The best difference tho is probably just the fact it's an EV with high Regen. Immediate acceleration AND deceleration with perfect throttle response make it an absolute joy to drive compared to any automatic transmission (which is never in the right gear and always takes forever and a day to downshift).\n\nStorage space is great. Have done long weekend trips with my young girls and have been able to carry everything. Noise level is better (2021's are much better in this respect), suspension comfort is equivalent to marginally better (overall very good), rattles and squeaks are maybe slightly increased (only during large bumps) but both did not have any issue here, seats are way more comfortable and perhaps the best I've ever sat in, room for car seats is equivalent to slightly better. \n\nThe touchscreen is surprisingly easy and convenient to use. Basic autopilot is mostly awesome and adaptive cruise works very well (has seemed to get much better recently, last 6 months or so). Not having a gauge cluster is one of the things I thought I would hate and now do not want to have again (the visibility is so good). \n\nThe negatives: low bumper for better aero means more rock strikes on the hood and windshield (already replaced a windshield), the doors feel cheap and flimsy like a Honda and not solid like a bank vault (ie Euro made premium car), paint is soft and easily chipped (likely due to California regulations).""
 '2019 M3 SR+ and I never plan to go away from Tesla. Best car I‚Äôve ever owned. \n\nDon‚Äôt underestimate the charging network‚Äôs importance. It‚Äôs a clear differentiator. \n\n\nTesla service for two cracked windshields (rocks), new tires at 44k mi, and front control arm replacement under warranty have been smooth, professional and reasonably priced, except for some minor instances getting the car back with broken interior panel clips and needed replacement.'
 'Well I don‚Äòt own another EV so can‚Äôt really speak to that. As for the Model 3, I‚Äôve had no reliability issues thus far. Most of the issues I‚Äôve had are fit and finish issues‚Ä¶which don‚Äôt bother me that much, but would probably irritate a lot of owners especially at the price these cars are going for nowadays. Quality of service can be hit or miss, but it‚Äôs always rushed and impersonal at least in my experience. It‚Äôs not uncommon for the car to go into service for one issue, and to come out with several more‚Ä¶again, in my experience. Supercharger network is great for longer trips, but I mostly charge at home. Unless you will be using it daily, it probably isn‚Äôt that important when choosing an EV imo.'
 'I started with a MY and now my garage have a MY and a M3. Teslas are the most convenient car I‚Äôve ever own or driven. If you pick at any one thing it might not necessarily be the best compared to other EVs but like an IPhone the integrated experience is simple and seamless. A Tesla offers a very minimalist experience but it has absolutely everything you need for a convenient experience. \n\nI‚Äôm at 21K miles on the MY now and the only work I need to do on it is to add washer fluid and I‚Äôm probably looking at a new set of tires around 25K miles. \n\nThe regular, free, and actual useful feature OTA updates on the car means the car is better and more useful today than the day I took delivery. When I picked up the car, my car didn‚Äôt have sentry camera views from the car and side view cameras on blinkers just to name two of the features I‚Äôve gotten. \n\nDoes other automakers make good EVs? Sure. Are other EVs better than Tesla‚Äôs in some respects? Sure. But having owned two Teslas for the past 2 years I don‚Äôt really want to trade in the Supercharger network and the superior SW experience of a Tesla to get say the fit and finish of a Toyota or a more accurate range gauge on the car (You should be using the Nav to estimate your SoC at the destination instead of using the stated range anyways cuz the Nav takes environmental factors and elevation gains into account). At the end of the day, a Tesla car is like Apple iPhone; it‚Äôs specs might not be the best and you‚Äôd have to pay a premium but it‚Äôs the best integrated experience that you can get.'
 'After 94k miles on the Model 3, I‚Äôm still wondering what people do at ‚ÄúTesla service‚Äù unless they wrecked their car?  I‚Äôve had zero issues.'
 'It‚Äôs really hard to beat the software on Teslas. You won‚Äôt miss things you think you will. Remember though, this is an echo chamber both good and bad, your best chance for real information is look for the local Tesla club, and talk to real people who own them.'
 'Sounds like your mind is made up. Why bother researching then ?'
 'I have a dual motor M3 which I purchased in September 2021. It was manufactured in China.\n\nNegatives:\n* I\'ve had multiple issues with errors from the charging port, which required a couple of visits to the service center and the eventual replacement of the charging assembly, which made the problem go away. Later a ""bad"" software update caused more phantom errors which went away.\n* The front left wheel initially made a crunching sound which required the wheel be removed and the brake disc to be sanded down.\n* One of the rear passenger doors used to stick a bit when closing but it went away over time.\n* The usual complaints about autopilot\'s limitations. I find it useless except on a limited access highway, and there it can give up unexpectedly, sometimes ""crash"" (""system failure""), and sometimes cause unexpected braking for no apparent reason.\n* Speed limit detection and adjustment are buggy and sometimes surprisingly bad.\n* ""580km range"" means 450km in highway usage at 120km/h.\n* It was unusually quiet in the highway at first but over time it has become much noisier. I suspect the door seals degrade quickly.\n\nPositives:\n* Autopilot does a great job of lanekeeping and maintaining distance. It has trained me to stay attentive but allows for my occasional distraction. IMO it will never be capable of ""full self driving"" but it\'s certainly a useful tool, but it does have a steep learning curve. I always use it and my husband does not as he finds it easier just to drive.\n* The mobile app works very well and the car responds quickly. I use my phone as the key and don\'t carry the key card at all.\n* The drive is smooth and the interface is pretty intuitive. Acceleration is excellent (even without paying for the ""boost"").\n* Visibility is excellent and the cameras and vehicle detection make lane changes much easier and safer. \n\nNotes:\n* Take special care in washing the front window and all cameras for good Autopilot performance.\n* Mine has bumper sensors which I consider an absolute *must have*. Parking spaces in Europe are tiny and garages are dark, and ""Tesla Vision"" isn\'t going to cut it. I wouldn\'t buy one without them, period, and that\'s what they\'re selling now.\n* The brand used to be cool but the Muskrat effect is real. I\'m probably going to have the decals removed.'
 ""Pretty much the exact opposite of the impression you must be getting on the internet. It's without a doubt the best car I've ever owned, and I've owned about 12 cars in my life. It's so good in fact that we sold my wife's CR-V for a MYP last year. \n\nThe online negativity towards the brand is hugely skewed. I'll bet most of the folks in, say r/realtesla don't even own a Tesla.""
 ""Had a Kia Niro EV. It was a fine car. Very efficient, but didn't have the tech and features of a Model 3. The Model 3 is a little bit of a bumpier ride, but not bad at all. The tech features are what sold me. Sentry mode, cameras recording while driving, and all the app features. Seems to be fine. I haven't had any major repairs or problems yet. (I hate Elon and I'm learning to hate myself every day with his antics) üòÖ""
 'We‚Äôve had a Leaf, Model S, RAV4 EV, Model X, 3 and a Y. The RWD LR M3 is my favorite to drive of all of them.'
 'If you plan on any long distance travel, I would ONLY recommend a Tesla (my experience is in the southeast US). People are seeing EVgo charging stations pop up all over and think it‚Äôs a done deal. However, they are not as available or reliable as the Tesla network. I would still be hesitant to own another EV unless it was only a daily driver.'
 'I‚Äôve had my M3LR since Dec 2021 and its been the best car I‚Äôve had, no faults at all and I love taking it for a drive every time! I‚Äôll be looking to go with a S or M3P next time round. I don‚Äôt do many long trips as I live in the UK so its hard to really travel many miles but on the few times I‚Äôve done 600-800 mile trips away from home the Supercharger network has been flawless. \n\nIf you wanna drive one Tesla are always email me to test drive a Y, if you have a service centre near you inquire about a 3 test drive!'
 'I\'ve had mine for about two months and love it. I went for the LFP car because I\'m frugal and I really wanted the longevity, I keep my stuff for a long time so this car will probably be with me 10-15 years. You get all the good Tesla stuff for much less money and I don\'t need ultimate speed anymore.\n\nI looked at other EVs but the base car is such a great value at 46k compared to the others in it\'s price bracket.  Way more performance, generally more range, and I really like all the tech you get with it. Also availability was a large part, the Ioniq and others were marked up like crazy and I could painlessly buy the Tesla. Picking it up was a breeze. \n\nQuality wise I\'m very happy with my car, no fitment or QC issues, the refreshed interior is really nice (it feels much better than the older cars). I haven\'t had to deal with service yet but it\'s very easy to make an appointment. If you damage the car it is kind of a pain, from what I hear it\'ll take a while and the car has a lot of aluminum which is expensive to work with and replace. The only gripe is that they are pretty stingy with the paint, I paid for the Blue color and it looks fantastic but in some of the hard to reach places there isn\'t full coverage. But you don\'t see that unless you go looking for it. \n\nOne the road it\'s extremely smooth, one pedal driving is calibrated perfectly. Very little wind noise in the cabin, it\'s quieter than all my previous cars and it\'s what you would expect for a 40 grand car. If you\'re paying 60k+ for a performance (essentially the same car, different motor) I can see wanting it to be better, but for the price I have no complaints. Over smooth or smooth-ish roads it\'s very quiet inside, over really rough surfaced pavement you\'ll hear it a bit. It\'s not as quiet as an ID4 in the regard. \n\nHandling is great and it\'s fun in the twisties, no complaints on power. I prefer a slightly stiffer ride so the suspension works great for me, it\'s very comfortable but a tick more in the sporty camp than plush. Nice damping over sharp bumps, no wallowing. I would just lower tire pressure, 45 PSI feels like driving on rocks. I have the 18"" wheels so take that into account, the larger wheels will probably feel different but I live in the Bay Area and you need sidewall here. \n\nCharging is GREAT. The battery is fairly small and the curve is nice, you\'re looking at coming from 10-60% in \\~12 minutes, 10-80% in \\~18 minutes. The supercharger network is fantastic. I love that I can charge to 100% daily if I want to. Efficiency is amazing, at 70mph I get 4.4wh/mi, 3.4wh/mi @ 85mph. This is during the winter, when it was around freezing I only got about 10% worse (heat pumps work great). I haven\'t driven the car yet when it\'s over 55 degrees outside yet, so it should get even better.'
 'I Hope you hadn‚Äôt pulled the trigger till today . Nice price drop.'
 'I love ours, also in SoCal. No real issues in 2 years of ownership. Had a rattle that was quickly taken care of. \n\nReplaced a 2011 A4 Quattro.'
 'Uk here. Best and cheapest car I have owned. Quality of build from China is very good too, less rattling than other cars despite what everyone else says'

 ""I've had mine  for 4 years now (early 2019 model AWD). The thing just works. No squeaks, rattles, panel gaps, ... Still as much a joy to drive as on day one (plus all the goodies that have since come in with OTA). The white interior holds up astonishingly well.\n\nRepairs: I've had the blinker stalk replaced early on (under warranty) because it would sometimes not do the '3-blinker-turn-indicator' thing reliably. Almost not worth doing but they fixed it quickly. (I also dinged the rear fender (my fault). Just took it to a body shop to have it doctored and painted. Cost was what I would have paid for such a repair on any other car.)\n\nInteraction with service center has been hassle free (blinker stalk replacement; tire changes summer/winter;  once to have brake fluid checked and cabin filter replaced). Scheduling via app is smooth and work was always done in about an hour with constant updates so I could go do some shopping/grab some breakfast in the meantime.\n\nIt passed the bi-annual mandatory checkup (T√úV) with flying colors (fun experience as it was the first one they had seen).\n\nHave not had any problems with superchargers. Plug & play every time. I have also not encountered a broken one, yet. I probably wouldn't go to another charger even if it was slightly cheaper - just because it's so convenient and there are always so many stalls.\n\nI've not noticed any dramatic extra tire wear (but I don't drive like maniac so I wasn't expecting any). Since I usually get new tires a bit before they are totally worn down my change schedule hasn't changed from my previous ICE car.\n\nRange/battery degradation: About 5% degradation. It hasn't impacted driving times since range is only relevant on long range trips and I still reach the same supercharger stops as before.\n\nAutopilot: AP is cool (I only have the basic one). I use it every day.\n\nNoise: Friend of mine has a 2021 Model 3 and that is noticeably quieter at highway speeds (though I wouldn't say that mine is loud. It's just something to be aware of and test when buying)\n\nOnly downside so far: Insurance isn't cheap. I wish they would offer Tesla insurance where I live.""
 'Lovely vehicle, no real issues charging on trips. Reliability is hard to say since it‚Äôs only 3 years old, it hasn‚Äôt left me stranded in the middle of the road, unlike my Jetta‚Äôs perennial mass airflow sensor issues. \n\nThere‚Äôs not a lot there in terms of repairing yourself. The motors are sealed, the battery pack is sealed. You‚Äôd basically be limited to doing body work or fixing auxiliary systems like the AC.'
 'My M3LR has excellent fit and finish and most everything works flawlessly, including Autopilot.  My lone complaint is substandard wipers, but I mitigated that with a ceramic coating on the glass.'
 'I got a 21 Tesla Model 3 LR. In mid-21 there were a handful of EVs to choose from, much less than today, so I went on a spree test-driving EVs. I went with 3 because it was the most efficient at the time, had excellent range, the Tesla charge infrastructure is prevalent in my region and had a good reputation, and by far it drove and handled best (particularly one-pedal driving). The price was <$50K\n\nI did not buy ‚ÄúFull Self-driving‚Äù as it seemed half-baked and the price was to high for the value.\n\nThe car has been reliable, at least over the 17K miles so far. I‚Äôve driven on a few regional road trips without any issues. It handles snow and ICE better than my Toyota, but I‚Äôm also wary because it‚Äôs heavier.\n\nMy issues so far: I had a tail light that had filled with condensation, which the service center swapped out for free in about 90 minutes. Also, The v11 software update had some stupid II changes (that they later addressed). Also, I once had phantom braking while using Autopilot (traffic aware cruise control) that I responded to by pressing the accelerator - most of the time it works astonishingly well.\n\nThe app integration works very well. I use the remote climate control and scheduled departures all the time.\n\nI was once cut off by a bus and the emergency braking did a good job at preventing collision.\n\nThe UI is easily the best of the EVs I tried (Mach E, ID.4, Kona). The steering wheel controls and voice commands pretty much eliminate the need for touching the display while driving. The auto wipers usually work well, but certain situations still stymie them; you can touch the stalk button to wipe once and bring up buttons on the UI to override, but I usually use a voice command instead. The auto headlights work well, but sometimes the auto-high beams don‚Äôt respond fast enough for my liking so I disable them by pushing on the stalk.\n\nStorage-wise, the trunk is very deep, and the under-trunk decent-sized. It‚Äôs not a hatchback, though. The frunk is reasonably sized. I keep the mobile charger, a blanket, a backseat cover for the dog, and an ice-scraper in there and there‚Äôs space remaining.\n\nI‚Äôm pleased with it. We have this and a Prius and we drive this pretty much all the time and the Prius when my wife and I have to be two different places at the same time (the one that has to drive farthest gets the Tesla).'
 'I‚Äôve had my Model 3 LR for a year now and it‚Äôs been absolutely lovely. No issues and it‚Äôs by far the most fun / convenient car I‚Äôve driven. Also upgraded w/ acceleration boost this past summer. No regrets so far.'
 'Tesla is actually an incredibly easy car to live with. Easy to charge. Just get in and go. Good battery and reliable powertrain. Definitely has quality issues with fit and finish, but that varies. Overall the model 3 is a great vehicle when said and done'
 'I have one of the first Model 3\'s, 2018, RWD, long range. \n\nLoves: Zero maintenance. Excellent road trip car, comfortable, great range, fast charging. Even the non-performance is ridiculously quick, way faster than any ""sport sedan"". App & phone key are awesome.\n\nProblems: Charge port door replaced twice. Body control module replaced. Little clip that holds the rear seat down replaced. All under warranty.\n\nNags: can\'t fit large items in back like Model S. Why is the steering wheel so small it makes me feel like a giant.'
 'I drove a 2012 Leaf for 3 years, a 2017 Bolt for 1 year and a 2022 Model 3 RWD for 1 year.\n\nI loved both the Leaf and Bolt-both were completely reliable and needed nothing maintenance wise in the time I owned them.  However I just took my Model 3 on a 3200 mile round trip last month from NY to Florida and it was surprisingly painless.  I never took my Bolt on anything farther than 400 miles round trip‚Ä¶even with a faster charging CCS equipped vehicle it‚Äôs hard to imagine it would have been as easy as the Tesla.  \n\nI only had to contact Tesla for one minor issue with a rear door hinge noticed after delivery.  Also relatively painless, made service appointment, deferred to a local body shop and had the car back in a few days at no cost.\n\nThe only real gripe I have is that living in a state that requires annual safety inspections, it‚Äôs frustrating that Tesla can‚Äôt inspect their own cars (due to state requirements they would need the equipment for emissions testing on ICE vehicles which they don‚Äôt have)- there are specific jacking instructions that require lift pads to not damage the frame/battery, and Tesla is very clear that damage caused by improper lifting will not be covered under warranty.  Leaving the manual page and my own set of jack pads on the console, giving instructions to the service tech‚Ä¶there‚Äôs still no way to know if the mechanic is actually following instructions or if they think they know better.  I took my Leaf and Bolt to their respective dealers for inspection with no concern.'
 'We got a Leaf, Ioniq, Kona EV, Ioniq 5 and and EV6 over the past years.  \n\nWe also had a 2015 Tesla S 70D and now a Tesla 3 SR 2022. \n\nWe kept the Tesla 3 and sold all the other cars. \n\nEV6 / Ioniq 5 were great, and the best non-Tesla EV we got to drive. It was better on some levels: Sound proofing, power and more space inside. \n\nDownsides were software that is years worse than Tesla. The 2015 software on the S was way better and also the car is overweight compared to a Tesla Y. ( > 10%). Daily experience is better with the Tesla 3 and that is the one we kept.  My guess is that a Tesla Y SR will be released soon and it will be very competitive.'
 'Important note, a 2018 Tesla 3 is not equal to a 2022 Tesla 3.  \n\nTesla has done continuous improvement (sound proofing, efficiency, range, quality) over the years. Keep this in mind when you compare.'
 ""Just want to say it's nice to see a question like this get answered positively by so many owners. There's so much negativity in the press and on reddit when it comes to Tesla.""

 ""i own 5 cars - 1964 ford galaxie fully built, 2007 dodge ram for towing, 2002 corvette z06 for track, 2022 MODEL 3, 2016 Model X (wifes car). Model 3 is the best car ever, hands down. in every way. Model X is awesome too. havn't had any issues with the M3. X screen went out, but otherwise it's great, and it's the first year of production. Love these cars.""
 ""Love it. Best car I've ever owned. Fastest, too.""
 'The Model 3 is my first EV, picked up in Nov 2022, came from a Corolla. Never had an expensive car like a BMW but my friends do, so I have very little experience in the ""premium feel.""\n\nI love the leather seats, much more comfortable than the Toyota and a little better (IMO!!!) than the 330i seats as I like cushiony feel over firm, like my mattress  preference. \n\nThe big screen vs knobs debate is overblown for me as the only 2 things I am messing with are heat/AC and wipers, both of which I set via voice. Even with knobs in the Toyota, I still had to look to set the heat to the right type (up towards the glass vs straight at you vs down by feet) so I never got the ""muscle memory"" argument.\n\nI have a garage with 240V charger and don\'t really do roadtrips, so the Supercharger network is nice as peace of mind but I doubt I\'d use it much. Instead, I\'m REALLY a fan of the LFP batteries Tesla uses in the RWD trim I have as range degradation was almost nothing for me and my driving style (opposite of a lead foot) during the negative F temperatures at the end of Dec. \n\nThe app is also really nice to have - I like being able to precondition while indoors and walk up to the car and it just unlocks with my phone in pocket and goes. It just werkz‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. Updates install nicely and I\'ve never had to go near a Tesla business after picking up my car. Regen braking and steering are amazing and I hate driving any other car that isn\'t tuned this way anymore.\n\nFinally, had no issues with manufacturing defects. I feel these complaints are from pre-2019 and cases are more rare now, and people just circle jerk for karma. No gaps on my car, suspension is fine on the NJ and NYC roads with the filled in potholes. \n\nOverall, 10/10 experience so far 2 months in.'
 'I‚Äôve put almost 100k miles in mine since buying it in 2018. I‚Äôve road-tripped this on all-day drives several dozen times including cross-country. Supercharging is excellent and is more convenient than pumping gas (no needing to download and register with damn apps at every station). \n\nThe software is equally excellent. I‚Äôll probably never find a car that‚Äôll match it, but Apple CarPlay is a mild contender. The car has so many features like dash cams, sentry mode, live-view, camp/dog mode, streaming video/games, etc. \n\nThe interior is spartan but easy to clean and keep looking clean. I wasn‚Äôt coming from a luxury car so that was no big deal. I have to explain the door handles to almost everyone I give a ride to, so I‚Äôve turned into a gentleman by opening the doors for my older friends. An instrument cluster/HUD and cooled seated would be nice. \n\nIt‚Äôs a fantastic car. I‚Äôm almost considering upgrading to a Y with the price drops and 4 years of changes.\n\nAnd yes, some people are political about EVs, especially older people. Some ask really ignorant questions and have skewed perceptions that I must be living with severe limitations by driving an EV. Others are blown away and I‚Äôve even had friends and family buy their own after driving mine.'
 'I moved away from my Tesla Model 3 LR after two years, mainly due to road noise. But I had also had several service appointments with Tesla to fix multiple rattles in the cabin, some of which were considered ‚Äúwithin spec‚Äù. Aside from those issues I think it‚Äôs a great car: fantastic UX, fun to drive, _extremely_ efficient (10-25% energy use compared to the competition), good interior space and software is best in class. \n\nIf the road noise (which is quite a bit worse than the competition despite what some might say, also after I had spent ‚Ç¨1500 aftermarket for professional noise dampening) hadn‚Äôt been an issue, I would still be driving my Model 3. Instead I now drive a BMW.'
 'So your saying you don‚Äôt like‚Ä¶. Android/Apple car play, XM Satellite Radio, Cooled seats, a shade for your Panoramic sun roof, a smooth ride with a quiet cabin, Most importantly a HUD to keep your eyes on the road and not on a screen?\n\nTesla is not the only option anymore keep your mind open to other brands.\n\nYes, Tesla has great cars but some people don‚Äôt want a Steering wheel, a Single screen for UI and some seats. \n\nLess is more, May work for some people. But I‚Äôm personally a More is More kind of person.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I chose the Ioniq 5 Limited over the M3 Performance or the MY.  For me I will get political and I wouldn‚Äôt give Elon a red cent.'
 ""I've owned 2 Tesla's, a 2015 Model S and 2018 Model 3. \n\nFrom the factory the Model S was missing the lining in the trunk and the Model 3 had a mismatched wheel. Both issues were taken care of but still not something you expect for a luxury car and a high priced sedan. \n\nPerformance wise both were better than most other EVs I've driven but didn't really need or use the performance of them 95% of the time. \n\nReal world driving range vs rated range was kind of a joke on both. Expect about 10-15% less than what Tesla says it will do. \n\nIntegrated technology (Route planning, navigation, internet connectivity, etc) was nice and far better than any other manufacturer has done. But the lack of apple Carplay/Android Auto, satellite radio, and not having physical buttons for common controls is kind of annoying. And even though I am a full supporter of over the air updates, the constant changes to the UI so you have to relearn where things are displayed or how to get to a setting the various menus are infuriating half the time.\n\nThe Model 3 is loud on the road. Newer ones are better than my 2018 but for an EV where you expect a quiet cabin, they are still quite loud. We got a Chevy Bolt EUV after a truck wrecked my Model 3 and I swear it is noticeably quieter while driving even for a car that is like $20k cheaper than a Model 3. \n\nFast charging is super easy on the Tesla network, which is probably the last major advantage Tesla has over other car makers now. Not having to mess with an app, card, or touch display to start charging is something I wish other charging networks would get right.""
 'I have an S which convinced two friends to get performance model 3s. Each has about 50K miles and no repairs. One has had three sets of tires, TeslaCorsa will do that to ya but is a testament to how durable they are.\n\nI must disclose that one had a misaligned trunk and the other a loose door panel. Both fixed at SC but a trip that should not have been needed.'
 'Supercharger network unbeatable in the USA\n\nCabin air filter is terrible I have to change every 30k miles or it smells like wet socks\n\nQuality can be improved\n\nYes EV runs cheaper then ice by a lot'
 'I loved my model 3, drove across country twice, with only little inconvenience. \n\nIn terms of a car, it feels like 10 years ahead of anything else. Like a smart phone when everyone else is using flip phones still. \n\nSold it to go carless cuz fuck cars.'
 'build quality is garbage, had a 2020 and fsd crashed car for me.  glad to be able to walk away'
 'Owned for 3.5 years and its awesome, still. A better car than I bought originally'

 'Have had mine for a year - zero issues with the car itself, it‚Äôs a joy to drive. There are issues with the mobile network provider in Switzerland, though - but this is local. Tesla chose an el-cheapo provider here with lousy coverage. Infotainment services often don‚Äôt work. Other than that, I love the car.'

 ""I've got 50k miles on mine. No complaints on maps or navigation. No Bluetooth issues either. Rear cross traffic alerts is a big miss in this price point and should be there. I've got fsd so no issues with lane changes and having to reingage autopilot. Ultimately if your nalot happy sell it. I'd give it some time first. I've test driven many other cars and they all feel like a step backwards compared to the tesla. Faults and all.""
 ""I'm delighted with my 3, but sell yours if you're not happy with it.""
 ""I sympathize with you OP. Tesla's technological prowess has slowed way down in the past year. You're not wrong to feel disappointed. Paying $200/mo for auto lane change is an added joke.""
 'I agree with you. Rear traffic alert needs to be more useful.'
 'Sounds like you should just sell it and drive your work vehicle.'
 'I don‚Äôt know how long you have driven it, but I‚Äôd wait a month to see if you feel differently about it. I enjoyed mine, but I sold it. I still own a Model S. Try enhanced autopilot for a month, and you might feel it‚Äôs a worthwhile upgrade. \n\nI have had rear cross traffic alert on two cars, and it‚Äôs invaluable. I also prefer blind-spot mirrors over Tesla‚Äôs approach.'
 'I think you mean autopilot which has to be reactivated. \n\nTesla‚Äôs Lane Assist is the same as the Ford lane keep. It‚Äôs turned on under the autopilot menu and stays on all the time. With Lane Assist, if you cross over the line, it will gently nudge you back. You don‚Äôt have to activate it like auto steer.\n\nFord‚Äôs version of Autopilot is called Blue Cruise. I also have a Ford with lane keep and it‚Äôs not comparable to Autopilot with auto steer. They are different things.'
 'For Autopilot (lane keep), what you‚Äôre talking about is a difference in mindset.  Tesla views AP, like FSD, as an all-or-nothing thing: either the car is driving itself, or you are.  If you intervene, you‚Äôve taken over, and the auto feature is now off.\n\nIt *would* be nice if they had a mode where it could be blended, where it could automatically keep trying to center itself in whatever lane you‚Äôre in, even after you change lanes manually.  But I can also see that that increases the software complexity quite a bit, and might also make the user interface more ‚Äúfuzzy,‚Äù where it could be more likely that the car could do something you don‚Äôt expect, if you forget that it‚Äôs still in that semi-automatic mode.  Having autosteer break off when you turn the wheel is a ‚Äúclean‚Äù interface, and a lot of people prefer it that way. \n\nBut mostly, I suspect, it seems like the company is pouring all its resources and talent into pursuing FSD, and doesn‚Äôt want to get bogged down validating and supporting major auto-drive features that aren‚Äôt directly on the path to FSD. \n\nPersonally, I have the FSD package (and EAP before that), so I may not be experiencing the same thing as OP, since I can have AP do lane changes for me.  But I only actually use that less than half the; usually I don‚Äôt trust it to do the lane change well enough when the situation is too dynamic; it‚Äôs usually too timid, even though it‚Äôs a lot better than it used to be.  So I break it off, and only re-engage when I‚Äôm settled into the new lane. The double-flick of the stalk is trivially easy to do. \n\nWhat I do really wish they‚Äôd fix is how AP tends to ‚Äúslop‚Äù to the outside of every turn, as if it only realizes at the last second that the road is curving.  If there‚Äôs a car in the next lane, that means I get uncomfortably close to them, and I often just take over if it‚Äôs a tight turn.  It *is* pretty annoying that they haven‚Äôt addressed this issue even slightly in my 4 years of ownership so far.'
 ""I agree with pretty much everything you said I traded in my Tesla for a Mach-E and I'm happier with everything except Ford's one pedal driving it's not near as smooth as Tesla's. I prefer Ford's Lane centering to Tesla autopilot to. It's difficult to describe but I kind of like how it's more passive instead of active if that makes sense. Another thing Tesla does better is the phone as a key, but with recent updates the Ford's getting a little better at that.""
 'Yeah. Somehow its hyped up to a level that is unreal. Good car . Not as groundbreaking as its made out to be.'
 'Sell. Get something else and avoid the service pain.  If your not in love the first service call will drive you over the Edge.  So get out quick and move on'
 'Have to agree. I really like the car but it misses a lot of features you would expect at that price. Not really sure how long they think they can keep stuff like this up'
 '>I didn‚Äôt realize that lane keep assist would go off and disengage if you cross over a line to avoid a pothole or trashcan or anything else without signaling. This is incredibly stupid in my opinion and something, that again, my work vehicle handles like a pro.\n\nWhat does your Explorer do if you manually steer it into another lane with full lane keeping assist on?\n\nIf you steer the car when it is in lane keeping autopilot then the car thinks you have taken over, so it disengages.  You then need to tell the car to engage again once you are past whatever happened.  [https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/model3/en\\_jo/GUID-ADA05DFF-963D-477D-9A51-FA8C8F6429F1.html](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/model3/en_jo/GUID-ADA05DFF-963D-477D-9A51-FA8C8F6429F1.html)\n\nIt sounds like you didn\'t read much about how the Tesla works before you got your car.  Your complaints don\'t quite make sense, did you not know Apple Play wasn\'t an option?  The navigation is its own app so you do have to figure out how it works, but I tend to just hit the mic and say ""Navigate me to <location or thing, such as coffee>.'
 'What issues are you having with navigation/maps? Maybe there‚Äôs something we can suggest here that can help, but we‚Äôll need more info on what‚Äôs going wrong. \n\nAside from that, yeah there a lot of growing pains with Tesla right now which are nearly all software related. Good news is that should change beforehand years end. The ultrasonic sensor removal was dumb, but their vision based solution for it has already been rolled out in software version 2022.40.1. That should help with backing up a bit. \n\nNext month (probably around Christmas) Tesla will be doing their yearly holiday update which will likely merge production software with FSD beta. That means Autopilot, which currently makes a lot of mistakes, will be using the brains that FSD beta is powered by along with the [updated visualization](https://i.imgur.com/KnX5ypP.jpg). This should make Autopilot a lot smoother while giving you more confidence in what it‚Äôs doing since you‚Äôll have a much better picture of what it‚Äôs seeing. \n\nAs for lane keep going off when you cross the lines, that can be disabled. It was added in a software update after a person fell asleep at the wheel, crossed the center line in a two-way tunnel, and died after getting in a head on collision. Since learning that I just keep it in as I‚Äôd minor deal with the minor annoyance of it going off erroneously sometimes as opposed to not having it go off at all. That‚Äôs your call though. \n\nAlso, for what it‚Äôs worth, Tesla isn‚Äôt perfect. No car is. A friend of mine has a Q4 e-tron and while it certainly is much nicer inside and far better built, he still has many complaints with it. His range is really poor, especially in winter where he gets like 170-180 miles on a charge (became an issue during our last ski trip‚Ä¶ his car fell way short on range and we had to go out of our way to find a charger while my car still had ~70 miles left after driving at the same speed as him). \n\nThat was his first road trip and let me tell you, he wasn‚Äôt happy. In fact, he actually said he wanted to trade it in for a Tesla after that. Grass isn‚Äôt always greener on the other side.'
 'You should see some other EV infotainment. Is Tesla‚Äôs perfect? No. Are they top 3 in the industry. Yes.\n\nI also will bet good money that if those little things big you this much, you are going to be extremely disappointed with the competition. \n\nBut do your diligence and try out others before making a massive decision like you are contemplating.'
 'I know what you mean. I feel Ike there was an incredible pace of exciting new features for the first years of the Model 3. Now since 2020 it feels like the experience is going backwards. The last 2 major updates were huge mistakes and took the whole year to make functional again. I dread the end of this year, they will probably fuck everything up again. üçæ\nI didn‚Äôt notice that with the sensors, just did an update this week so I‚Äôll have to check it out.'
 'I view mine as a commuter appliance. It‚Äôs not special.'
 ""I've never had to re-engage lane keep/auto steer on changing lanes.\n\nIf you have auto steer/auto nav turned on, it will change lanes for you. If you manually take control and move the steering wheel too much while it is auto Navigating, it (correctly, imo) returns full control to you. Hitting the brakes turns off both navigation and auto steering.""
 'That‚Äôs a shame. I‚Äôve had none of those issues. I just bought another Tesla.'
 'It just depends on what you expect out of the car. If these are basic things you expect out of a car, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. To each their own. But I would not expect Tesla to add or improve these anytime soon.'
 'Its a car from last decade, so ...'
 ""Most of those issues will probably be fixed in time through software updates, that is if you don't mind waiting.""
 'You don‚Äôt have fsd or eap. With eap you will just signal for lane change and it will do on its own. However if you take over, you have to re engage it yourself'
 ""I Love My 2022MYLR, only 3000 miles on it each ride is better than the last. Every time I get in my car I feel like I'm stepping into the future.""
 'I think you hyped yourself and did a lot of reading online\n\nJust drive the car for a bit and see how you feel\n\nJust about anything that gets over hyped is disappointing'
 ""yeah totally agree, Tesla has an impressive marketing machinery, making it look like the most advanced car ever.\n\nFor me it feels like this incredible marketing makes the car disappoint when you actually drive one. The best I have found so far, is autosteer on the highways, which really works incredibly well. And that's it, that is all the technology that I got out of a 70k car \\^\\^\n\nMy 8 year old Golf has better ACC (no phantom braking, no annoying beeping without any real threats etc), better parking sensors, does actually park automatically, has a back window you can actually look out of etc.\n\nIt's a shame really, they have the right visions, they just don't deliver on them. And yes, less sensors is not a good thing, I don't care what the vision people talk about""
 'When I change lanes and a car is in my blind spot all I get is a red car and red lane markings. I never hear a beep or anything. Is this normal? I never hear rear cross traffic either. I have a May 22 build with sensors.'
 'I was disenchanted when I first got my Y too. I love my car now. It may need tweeted. About the blue tooth file a bug report w a time stamp. Call Tesla in Freemont CA. Customer service is great. Not sure if you tried rebooting?  And about the lane assist put your turn signals on. Good luck. \nOh yes the GPS sucks. This needs help big time. Need to ask did you get FSD?  \nMy 2020 was FSD and I got hit hard at a red light.(car should have been totaled) but traded for 2022 without FSD. ‚Ä¶.. I couldn‚Äôt use it here. No one drives the speed limit.   Good luck.'
 ""Sounds like you should trade it in on an Explorer. \n\nIt does things differently than what you're used to. If you don't like that, that's fine. It's not for everyone.""

Regardless of what you do with the car, you should talk to a professional about the impulsivity you‚Äôve displayed.  And yes.  Overly critical due to not being informed.'
 'FINALLY! Thank you for an honest post. It really isn‚Äôt worth it. A ‚Äúclose relative‚Äù of mine bought one and all I do is Google crap they call me about because they don‚Äôt know how to use it. In the future these cars probably won‚Äôt have windows, steering wheels, displays. Just 4 seats and a door. LOL'
 'Just got mine.\n\nSo far not very impressed with FSD, maybe I need to study it more but so far I am not sure what it does. To me FSD is when I get into my car and say ""Hey car, drive me to my cousin Alex in Parsippany, NJ.""\n\nThere was sitting water around the seal in the back of trunk after driving in the rain.\n\nSome vibration when driving, I think it is the tires. Then again I am super sensitive to vibration and almost every car that I ever owned always has some vibration at one point. \n\nThen again, once I got a new Mercedes, pulled (slightly) at a grab handle above the door and it came off, lol.'
 ""I'm doing a 30 day rental of a model 3 to see how I like it.  I agree...the camera system isn't 'state of the art'.  But just because it's got a tesla badge, I guess we can't expect every single thing to be cutting edge.  \n\nI've never used self driving before, and ok with it relinquishing control after I avoid a pothol or change lanes.  When I take control for any reason, I'd be shocked if the car took control back from me without the order.  That would get confusing.  \n\nThe GPS is crap.  Google based?  If so, it missed a few updates along the way. I completely agree this needs a revamp.  \n\nAs for the Bluetooth, for my android phone, it's rock solid. I'd tell tesla about that.  You might need a new Bluetooth router.  Otherwise, I'm loving the car.  If I get a Y, I'm hoping it has comfort suspension (it's too stiff for me) and dual pane windows to make it more quiet.   Good luck with yours!  Just stomp on the accelerator whenever yo7 get frustrated....or drive by a gas station charging $6/gallon, ride on your horn and give those icer's the finger.  That'll make you smile.""

Can you tell me how that process went for you, and how the price compared?'
 'You forgot the auto wipers.'
 'Good balanced review, my 4 year Model 3 experience lines up almost 100%.  Was a great car for the price back then, now theres too much competition to take some of the warts at this price range.\n\nA/C seems to be a frequent issue.  One of my neighbors got a Model 3 a year after me and ended up back&forth to service all summer trying to get it fixed.\nEven in a car with working Heat & A/C, the A/C is not very powerful in the Model 3/Y.\nStepping into a competing car I was shocked how much more quickly the car could come come down to temperature & automatically maintain it without lots of fiddling.  Also physical air vent controls are mandatory for me again.\n\nPhantom braking is a huge issue, almost all owners will sheepishly admit they have experienced.\nIt gets better and worse with software updates.\nEasily happened 1 times per 100mi highway driving on Autopilot.  Further, the alert noise to get the driver to take over steering in AP confusion events frightens the whole car.  Got about 1 per 100mi of those too.\nThere\'s some conjecture that it happens more on Model Y due to the training data being mostly Model 3 and the camera locations being slightly different.  Not to mention the removal of radar. \nIt was somewhat random and hard to predict where it might happen.\n\n$15k for FSD is clearly robbery, but even $6k for EAP is aggressive considering competing brands offering competent highway assist in the base package or for max $2k as an option.\n\nI think 2017-2020, if you could get an AWD Model 3 for $50k range after tax incentives, it was a no-brainer given the price & competition.  \n\nAnyone looking in 2022-2023 and contemplating putting down $70-80k for a Model Y really, really, really need to go test drive the competition.  There was a brief moment you could get a Model S and even Model X in the $80k range back in pre-2020 era.\n\nAt that price range you can get cars with luxury interiors, ventilated seats, massage seats, HUD, 3d-view, real blind spot detection, CarPlay/Android Auto, satellite radio, amazing speakers, etc.\n\n(Pricing note for the OPs spec: 20"" induction, 7 seater, non-white, LR (not Performance) Model Y with EAP (but not FSD) is now $79k)'

I went in one for the first time the other day. The Uber driver rolled up but did not get out. He popped the boot so we could put our luggage in. I gently closed it but all sorts of horn sounds went off! So I got the fear and let the driver closed it remotely.\n\nThen of course it came to get in the car and I couldn't figure out the handle and didn't want to anger the driver further so just stood there like an idiot until someone wound down the window and told me how to get in.""

Seems like that would disqualify it. Same with the center console.

 ""Bummer experience for you. We have many of the same observations with our Model 3, but we have had only minor quality problems. Overall, we still love the car. Having it to do over, we wouldn't have paid for the FSD feature. My wife is nervous with the car taking control, so it is a lot of money for something that we rarely use.

 'I definitely don‚Äôt like the steering, it‚Äôs too twitchy and the turning radius is abysmal. Sucks to park the car in tight California spots because the car just won‚Äôt turn. \n\nOne pedal isn‚Äôt also so good. In San Diego it‚Äôs quite hilly and the braking performance suffers going down hill. It doesn‚Äôt do a constant acceleration braking so sometimes it takes way too long to stop on a downhill slope. It also is too twitchy in normal mode where pushing it just a tiny bit gives you 30% acceleration off the bat so the car feels ‚Äúfaster‚Äù. So I drive in chill mode but then the accelerator feels like a rubber band and flooring it doesn‚Äôt kick it out of chill. When you quickly let go of the accelerator, regen takes a while to kick in. Too long in my opinion. \n\nHonestly the best accelerator dynamics where on my Nissan leaf. It was so responsive, downside was regen was much less and one pedal driving on that car was terrible because it took forever to start a regen. In regular mode regen kicked in instantly. \n\nBTW I just learned that for the overhead speakers to work, you need to select immersive sound to be high.'

The weird thing is the A/C always works perfectly in the first 10 minutes or so in the trip. it is no fun to drive in South Florida heat, so totally understand your feeling.\n\nThen I switched to a different SC. The technician showed me the error message: the A/C compressor was inhibited. He said th A/C compressor is overheating and was turned off to protected it. He ordered the A/C compressor and a week later, I dropped the car. He ended up only replacing a thermo sensor, and it worked well so far (for about 2 weeks). The part only cost 30$, but all the diagnostic (they charged 3 diagnostics) cost more than 800$.

 ""Appears to be ABS plastic (or similar), which is much better than the fiberboard they use (or did) on Model 3.  Those would detach regularly, sometimes acting as a snowplow.  They also had a forward-facing seam, which made a great scoop-mode.  Owners would drill holes to attach a metal support to secure that end and keep it from dropping and scooping.  First I've read of a problem in years, so likely all Model 3 now have a similar design.  Appears a competent design now from the photos and perhaps the assemblers just didn't clip it in correctly, or the driver went thru a deep puddle or high-sided on snow to break it loose.""

From what I understand, issues like this are far more common in 2020 and up models.  \n\nIn theory, if I traded to a new Tesla, I would have it under warranty and could have any issues fixed.  But the nearest dealer is a two hour drive away from me, and I keep hearing horror stories of them holding cars hostage for months while they either have to wait on parts or have a ton of other cars in the queue.  Given that newer year models are notorious for crazy issues like this, I'm not in a mood to take that gamble.\n\nTesla (and their disciple fanboys) would like to have everyone believe that they are a mature EV manufacturer.   In many ways they're right because the software, charging network, and other things are way ahead of any other company.  But in many other ways, they've got a lot to work on and have even taken steps back in recent years.  \n\nI'll go back to an EV at some point if Tesla ever improves (and boots Elon out), or I'll wait for other companies to improve their product.

It keeps the car from sleeping. Had this been turned off, it wouldn't have drained as much and probably would have been more comparables to the Kia. \n\nGood write up!""
 'I don‚Äôt understand the comments about charging.  There are at least three Tesla superchargers between Denver airport and Colorado Springs and about five or six to Moab.  You would just need to enter your final destinations and the car tells you where to charge and how long.'
 '> I never quite got the break-shift-cardkey-tap order quite right.\n\nThe easiest thing to do is just stick the cardkey in the cupholder right when you get in. Then treat the brake pedal the same as the ""ON"" button or key-turn in modern gassers. Then you can put it into gear.\n\nI discovered the ""keycard in the cup holder"" trick myself today, after 4 years of Model 3 ownership, as I\'m also renting a Model 3 at the moment. I just sold my old one, and I\'m taking delivery of a new Model Y next week.\n\n> Charging at my sister\'s house didn\'t work (it didn\'t like the length of the extension cord or something). \n\nQuite likely the extension cord wasn\'t low enough gauge wire. I believe you need at *most* 12-gauge to charge an EV, since it\'s a continuous 12A draw. Most home appliances don\'t draw anywhere near that much, so companies get away with making most extension cables 14-gauge or higher.\n\n> having to map out my travel to ensure I get all the charging stations seemed like a real pain.... \n\nTeslas will actually do this for you. Just put in your destination, and if you have to charge on the way, it\'ll tell you where and how long to do so. That said, if you\'re not able to charge while *at* the destination, you\'ll want to put your destination in as just a waypoint, then tell the car to navigate back to where you started, so that it\'ll suggest appropriate charging for the entire round trip.\n\n>  I wanted to like autopilot (beyond the visualizations which was really cool), but I just couldn\'t trust it.\n\nIt took me several days to fully trust it, back when I got mine in 2018, so I don\'t blame you here. It\'s definitely an ""acquired taste"".'
 'Range anxiety goes away pretty fast once you have an electric car. You get to know where the chargers are, you know how much the car consumes electricity and you plan accordingly. Do not let that stop you from buying an electric. I am not a Tesla fan, but I got to say that they really nailed the charging since they own the chargers and the car plans the trip for you. Very convenient.'
 'Yeah, the Hyundai/Kias that are based on ICE models are boring. Which is exactly what some people (my dad) want. The EGMP-platform models (Ioniq 5, EV6,) are far more on par with Tesla on the tech front.'
 'Just want to note, my dad complained about my Tesla using the key card before I set his phone up. He said it was a night and day difference for him.\n\nThe frunk does feel way too delicate in my opinion. I have a 2018 so I can‚Äôt speak to any changes they made but I feel like I could easily break my frunk if I got angry enough.'
 'The hood is aluminium on the tesla. its meant to be light.\n\nMost of the stuff int he tesla you setup once on your driver profile and forget about it. such an easy car to live with day to day. Esp if you are changing drivers'
 'The rental experience on a Tesla is subpar without app access.\n\nIf you have the app, it eliminates use of the keycard.  I keep mine in my wallet for emergencies,  but have never actually needed it.\n\nSentry mode uses about 100w continuously.  If you are on a trip without good charging options, you probably want to turn it off.\n\nYou were probably using a 16ga extension cord, you need at least a 12ga cord to charge a car.  The car stopped charging to prevent a fire.\n\nUse the built-in navigation to plan your charging stops, it is very good at calculating your range, and how much energy you need.  Voice command is extremely useful for most of the commonly used controls, including music, climate, wipers, phone, and navigation.'
 'Interesting experience. My first EV experience was with the prior generation Niro - a 2021. I took it overnight from Los Angeles to San Diego and back. It was nice and your analogy of a car that happens to be electric is spot on. \n\nI hope Hyundai/Kia quality has improved over the years.'
 'If you owned the car, you‚Äôd adjust the side mirrors once and be done - the settings (along with seat & steering positions) are saved to the driver profile. Having physical buttons or prominently accessible on screen controls for mirror adjustments would be unnecessary clutter and distracting.'
 'It took me a very long time to get used to the undersized side mirrors on the Tesla. And that was coming from a much smaller car. It‚Äôs something that surprises me that more people don‚Äôt talk about.'
 ""I've owned a Tesla for almost 6 years now, and I could not agree more about the UI being unintuitive. Every time a new person gets into my car and wants to change something, I need to explain it to them. Something you didn't seem to need was to change the wiper setup, which is easily the best example of their worst design.\n\nSome noises from a parked Tesla are normal- quiet coolant pumps and things like that. You should not hear the HVAC pump or fans going when you get out of the car, though. Something's wrong with the car you rented, and that's especially true if it had noticeable battery drain over night.\n\nAs for charging, eventually it's exactly the same as driving a gas car around. You learn how fast the car uses battery, and you know where charger locations are. I rarely think about it unless I'm on a road trip, and in those situations I just punch my destination into the computer and it figures everything out for me. The same is true on all modern EVs. They plan charging stops and the route for you.\n\nSounds like you jumped right into the fire with EVs. It gets much easier to own and use them over time, and I bet if you had someone explaining how to do things it would have been easier on you getting the Tesla setup the way you like. But for sure it does a lot of things different just to be different.""
 'Tesla might have drained because of Sentry more overnight as well'
 ""I took a trip in my Model 3 from San Jose, CA to Las Vegas. It was fun seeing the same set of Teslas at the charging stations along the way. No concerns getting there at all. Lots of stations.\n\nOn the way back, we took a trip through Death Valley. Had no problems, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't concerned about range. But that was more about being in the middle of the desert as it was getting close to dark and no cell service with my charge running low. We pulled into the charger with 7% charge left. A bit too close for me out in the middle of nowhere. We weren't the only Tesla out there, either. We saw at least two others. The rest of the trip back was fine. It was a memorable trip for sure.""
 'The UI complaints by OP are non-issues for owners. They‚Äôre either things you don‚Äôt do at all (key card) or you only do once or very infrequently (mirrors).\n\nEven so, the mirrors and steering wheel adjustments are executed well in the UI in my opinion. Also both are on the quick access controls - one press to open the car settings and both are right there. As far as the key card, I haven‚Äôt done it in ages but I know you just tap the card on the console and then just‚Ä¶drive. There isn‚Äôt any specific sequence needed.\n\nTbh, Im surprised by anyone agreeing the tesla UI is not intuitive. Even my non-tech savvy 78 year old father has no issues, and I just taught him two weeks ago that mobile banking exists. Tesla‚Äôs software alone I think is what would keep me from going to other brands currently. The standard infotainment UI/UX of pretty much any other car feels like using a blackberry again to me after Tesla. That extends also to the mobile app. I was in a family member‚Äôs new Mercedes recently and the UI is atrocious. Even new it feels outdated.'
 'Thank you for the write-up.'
 'I‚Äôve rented a few teslas and the key card thing is awful. I own a Tesla and the single most enjoyable part of that car is not having a key. \n\nCharging can be a disaster. This is not a Tesla issue. Super chargers are awesome. Everything else is anywhere between plug in and walk away to fight with an app for 15 minutes to eventually give up and leave. At this point I could not imagine owning an ev without the ability to charge at home. Maybe only charge at work‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not going to work for everyone. But to rely on public chargers is not a viable solution.'
 'I just took delivery of my first Tesla, a Model Y, in early. February.\n\nThe Tesla definitely takes some getting used to, and that\'s coming from someone who has had a Nissan Leaf since 2015.\n\nI completely agree about the ""Autopilot"" being sub-par.  It\'s nowhere near what Musk implies it is.  Also, I rented a 2022 Model Y with the ultrasonic sensors, and now I feel like my 2023 is crippled by the lack of them.  I have no proximity warnings to go by, as they haven\'t enabled them in the camera-only software suite.\n\nAnyhow, I still love the car.  It takes a while to get used to its ""Teslaness"" but now that I\'ve adapted to it, when I get in my wife\'s 2023 Bolt EUV which arrived at the end of February, it feels old-fashioned and weak.  The acceleration in the Tesla is absolutely brutal, and I didn\'t even spring for the Performance option.\n\nThat being said, if you want a more ""normal"" EV, the Bolt is the way to go.  It\'s simply the next step in the evolution of the Leaf we\'ve had for 8 years, and most folks will be happier with their initial or short-time experiences in it precisely because it\'s familiar and more intuitive.\n\nI\'m not a Musk or Tesla fanboy (in fact I find Musk embarrassing and I wish he wasn\'t such a huge part of the Tesla culture) and I try to be fair when I write this stuff.  Just wanted to add my perspective having current knowledge of the state of comparable 2023 EVs.'
 'We have both, 2023 Tesla M3 and 2022 KIA Niro EV. I always preferred to drive SUVs and switching to a Tesla was a big change. The lack of buttons and switches turned me off initially but after a while I got use to it. Tesla is fun to drive.\n\nKIA has a traditional feel and it like a utility , nothing exciting but good city driving car.'

 'I have a Kia Niro EV and the description ‚Äùit‚Äôs a car that‚Äôs electric rather than an electric car‚Äù is the perfect description, and the reason I got one. \n\nIt‚Äôs just a car.

I have owned an ev for 5 years now and have just purchased a second one for my partner so my feeling going in were a bit different from yours.\n\nRange anxiety was a non issue\\*. with some a little advanced planning you know where to stop and charge so its really not a problem. \\*with tesla, using the car's nav will tell you when and where to charge along your route to arrive at your destination with at least 10% left. this is great IF your destination has available charging. for my trip, the car would remove charging stops if i drove efficently, however, I would still need to charge since I would not be able to once at the destination (I was visiting with customers and staying at hotels, so no destination or overnight charging). The solution I found was to enter in all the destinations for my trip into the nav at once, making the car think i was going to one right after the other. this forced the car to add in charging stops at locations that made sence.\n\nDriving experience and ease of charging were this cars strong points. pleasure to drive, nice acceleration and handling. cabin noise was louder than my car however.\n\nLivibility is this cars weak point imho. The door handles are difficult to use unless you have the exact perfect form. trying to open the door with a bag or phone or keys in your hand is a hassle. controling every aspect of the car through the screen is not good. it is menus and setting to change anything from steering wheel position to wiper speed to opening the glove box. does the minimalist asthetic look good - yes. is it practical for everyday life - no. \n\noverall I do understand the draw to the M3, it is a good looking car that drives well, is quick and compared to other luxary brands, is good value. however, I will not be buying one as my next EV.""

 'A few of the issues associated with the Tesla are just non-owner issues I.e. using the key card.  Once you are a owner the phone app is super smooth and just lets you enter/exit/start with no issues.  Once you get used to the HVAC controls and UI of the Tesla it‚Äôs very intuitive, but take a a few weeks.  \nAlso, testing the range of one in a mountain area vs costal area is not really fair, elevation will adversely effect any EV quite a bit.'
 ""You are the first person I've heard have a difficult time charging with a Tesla. Tesla is the opposite.

 'I suppose adjusting the mirrors might be annoying, but if you make an account/profile the setting will be saved. Any tesla you get in afterwards will adjust to your preference. In many ways you only ever have to set it once and you\'re done ""forever"". \n\nThe stock, I agree, is probably unintuitive. But I\'d say that is true of any car if you\'ve never driven one. A quick ""relearning"" and it\'s pretty good. Older large vehicles used to have a stock like this too. It\'s a little different in how it was activated, point being, it\'s in a different place than modern shifters. In any car I\'ve ever driven you\'ve had to have your foot on the brake to shift, so it\'s possible I\'m misunderstanding the issue you had. \n\nI do agree about air control. I think they went for aesthetic rather than function here. I\'ve never had a gripe or issue with manually adjusting them. \n\nGotta say, I\'m surprised you made no mention of of one pedal driving. That was probably the biggest difference for us.'
 ""The only reason you had to use the key card is because you were renting the car. No one else uses the key cards and it's fantastic. Frankly it's the one of a few features keeping me with Tesla currently. I don't even have to think about locking or unlocking or remembering to bring a key fob or open my phone app or anything. Just walk up to the car get in a drive and then park and walk away. It really is that simple. You don't have to fiddle with your phone at all like other brands. No pulling up an app, no taping your phone to the door or what ever. No key fobs to carry around.""
 ""the keycard experience is really limited to rentals in actuality... actual owners would use the keycard once in a blue moon... the phone key and the optional fob works great and is a seamless experience from getting in to shifting into drive... keycard is meant as a backup, they should really set up your phone app as a phone key as part of the rental process...\n\nyeah current version of autopilot is pretty jarring, early reports of V11 in limited rollout right now is positive and has huge improvements so will wait and see...\n\nit's good that you didn't do the same long distance trip in the Kia, if you had range anxiety in the tesla, you wouldn't like the current CCS experience at all...""
 'Renting a Tesla vs. owning one has a very different. For one is Tesla sending you information with links to new driver experience videos, and you are best prepared at the time you pick up your new car. Most Rental companies that have Teslas do not give you more introduction beyond where to place the card to get into the car, start the car, lock the car.\n\nAn actual new owner will get in their car and directly be presented with creating a driver profile and the controls of adjusting mirrors and steering wheel. You will also have access to the car in the Tesla App, which makes a lot of things even easier.\n\nI would wish Tesla would offer Rental companies a Mode in their App to add the rented car and that the car would always be reset and then synced with your profile through the App.\n\nMany new owners are also way too shy using the voice commands to get things going. It‚Äôs actually very natural. I guess it is due to legacy cars not having such good software.'

And you know what? It's no surprise. There's this hilarious anecdote about Honda buying a Porsche GTS to develop the NSX, and when they took it apart, they found a note of encouragement from the Porsche team to Honda in the engine compartment.""
 '/r cars in shambles'
 '> Toyota estimates Tesla‚Äôs use of structural battery pack and front & rear casting has enabled the EV maker to cut 220 pounds from the weight of the Model Y. In addition, Toyota believes this approach has allowed Tesla to increase the Model Y‚Äôs range while at the same time decreasing manufacturing cost.'
 ""Not really hard to believe if you‚Äôve seen tear downs of other Teslas or analysis from Sandy Munros Youtube.  Easiest way to put it is that Tesla‚Äôs are designed from the ground up to be EVs and don‚Äôt share parts with ICEvs so they are very well packaged\n\nFrom what I've seen, when Tesla engineers see something inefficient, they are allowed to design from scratch to address whatever it is.  EVs from other companies are built with different mentalities, with some being as bad as EVs built on ICE platforms using only off-the-shelf parts.""
 'This isn\'t terribly shocking. There was a German automaker that bought an original Model S. Tore it apart, and said, ""Well shit, it\'ll take a decade to build a competitor."" Or something to that effect.'
 '*word of mouth article that‚Äôs positive about Tesla*\n\nr/cars: I sleep\n\n*word of mouth article that shits on Tesla*\n\nr/cars: real shit?\n\nThis falls in line with many of the other teardowns of Teslas, especially after production has been ramped up (while ramping is often quite iffy). Their casting of the rear subframe is an **incredible** thing of engineering and manufacturing. \n\nHate em or love em, they‚Äôve done some novel, very interesting things with EV design and manufacturing.'
 ""I don't hate Tesla but articles with no named sources are usually fake news.""
 'So basically I can make up a story about anything and say it was given to me in conditions of anonymity? This is a joke of an article and should be grouped with clickbait ads on sketchy websites.'
 '>A Toyota executive who took part in the Model Y teardown spoke with Automotive News in conditions of anonymity and said about the all-electric crossover ‚Äútaking the skin off the Model Y, it was truly a work of art. It‚Äôs unbelievable.‚Äù\n\nSo no evidence except what a journalist claims?'
 'It‚Äôs kinda crazy it took Toyota this long to do one'
 "">A Toyota executive who took part in the Model Y teardown spoke with Automotive News in conditions of anonymity and said about the all-electric crossover ‚Äútaking the skin off the Model Y, it was truly a work of art.

 'The structural battery pack is quite impressive and does allow for lower manufacturing and assembly costs, while also reducing weight. The tradeoff is the complete and utter lack of repairability of the battery pack. The entire thing is sealed shut with structural foam, and includes not just the cells but the BMS system, battery coolant sytem, and the main contactors and relays. Eventually, if one of those parts fails, the entire battery pack will have to be scrapped and replaced.\n\nIt also makes it much harder to repurpose batteries after the pack reaches end-of-life or the car is totaled in a crash, since individual cells or battery modules are nearly impossible to extract from the pack.'
 'Engineering and manufacturing are two different things folks. \n\nSomething can be well engineered, but manufactured poorly. Toyota, the gold standard of manufacturing, is allowed to be impressed by Tesla‚Äôs engineering and the rest of the world can shit on Tesla‚Äôs build quality and both be right.'
 'People need to stop thinking Toyota is the god of quality.  I‚Äôve owned Tacomas for nearly 12 years.  But the last 4 years I‚Äôve had a Tesla, it‚Äôs honestly been a better vehicle.  less problems, less maintenance, etc..  sure there are some paint issues and questionable body gaps, but my Tacomas weren‚Äôt perfect either.'
 ""Wow that's high praise. Credit where it's due, well done Tesla üëçüèª""
 'Good thing is that perception of Art is subjective...'
 'I‚Äôve had everything from supercharged E92 M3s, E46 M3, Toyota FJ62/FJ80, Hellcat and I bought a Tesla 3 performance in 2021.\n\n\nNever looked back, I commute 6 days a week plug the damn thing in and forget about maintenance and gas. The car is as fast as a McLaren and I don‚Äôt feel guilty stepping on it. \n\n\nIt‚Äôs one of the safest cars on the road and makes my commute a breeze. Still miss the E92 M3 though.'
 'Not that I disagree a TMC exec had some praise for Tesla\'s underlying architecture, but Torque News and Electrek (also carrying this article) are basically Tesla shills so I\'d take their articles with a grain of salt. \n\nI don\'t see Tesla\'s questionable ethics, abysmal safety record, and laughable quality control as ""works of art"" but hey, they do have a cutting edge electrical architecture and I agree there.'
 'I mean, he‚Äôs not wrong. The cars are extremely safe in crashes, highly aerodynamic and extremely cost-effective. They‚Äôre well-engineered vehicles. They just aren‚Äôt built right, but you don‚Äôt really notice those kinds of things when you‚Äôre disassembling a vehicle'
 'There is a lot of advance engineering that goes into Teslas. It‚Äôs the implementation that is all messed up. I give it a few more years and I‚Äôd expect them to figure out the build quality/repair situation. With how often they‚Äôre redesigning internal parts I understand why they won‚Äôt sell parts to the owner. It‚Äôd severely limit their ability to improve existing parts. \n\nBTW, didn‚Äôt tesla say they had a few new colors that were available? Like the one pictured. I have yet to see that color anywhere besides generated photos. It looks great.'
 'Weird. r/cars told me Tesla was trash'
 'Impressive as they may be, all their cars are overdue for redesign and competition is heating up.'
 'Perhaps mechanically but it looks like a fucking turd'
 'The 2023 Prius even looks better and nicer than a Tesla.'
 ""Actually this highlights how late they are. Structural battery goes for any dedicated EV chassis which Toyota currently don't have. I'm sorry buy this was news when the Model S came out ten years ago.""
 'Lol, Tesla is recognized as one of the worse build cars in the world. How much Tesla shares the Toyota dude has i wonder. If you want to see work of art go in a porsche or audi e tron or Mercedes, or bmw. Tesla work of art, looool, like saying that hotdog is a 5 star menu.'
 'Oh no we hate Toyota now'
 'Meanwhile everyone has overlooked this from the article: ‚Äústructural battery pack‚Äù.\n\nYep, the battery pack is part of the structure. Gee, let‚Äôs just make fuel tanks into bumpers.'
 'I hope Toyota learned a lesson in what cars should look like.'
 'Rust under the back seats, body panels that dont line up, some of the worst paint on an automobile Ive ever seen and Toyota is impressed? Doesnt take much does it?'
 'Work of art? Thats the ugliest car sold on the market today'
 'But Toyotas are ugly. Unless he talking 90s.'
 ""A giant Japanese company like Toyota would never disparage another company publicly.  Japanese people would most likely compliment anything they are shown and just quietly give their honest opinion among their close friends in private.  That's the culture.  And from a business perspective, they gain nothing from saying negative things about Tesla and  have everything to gain from praising them.""
 'What an ugly car'
 'The exec sure. Meanwhile the techs are all look at this bullshit.'
 'Until it self crashes or explodes, that is. :)'
 ""How is this a surprise. Tesla is leaps and bounds ahead of competitors and when it comes to the power engineering of the vehicle. Yes they suck at interiors and putting together the actual exterior shell, but that will get better with time. The germans manufac already have them beat when it comes to interiors and literally everything else. The germans manufacts also like to use higher voltages to reduce current needed and charge faster. The new Audi charges faster than the Telsa but the Tesla has more overall range. This is all from memory. I can't cite/fact check everything, please do that on your own accord.\n\nBut really.. In all honesty, electric cars powered by batteries is not the solution. I do not want to reveal too much personal information about myself. But I know a lot of professors who are top in their fields, ranging from chemistry, to power electronics that know battery powered EV's are not scalable. But the industry, politicians/consumers already blindly on board and ignoring the critical issues. Yes EV+battery= product to market quickly, but EV+Battery= not scalable in the next decade""
 'Tucked tee shirts, especially at the gym.' 'Fake news'
 'It‚Äôs a fucking shapeless egg‚Ä¶‚Ä¶mainstream car design is comparable to the colour beige. Uninspired and boring‚Ä¶‚Ä¶'
 ""They weren't even trying to tear it down. It just kind of fell apart before it got there.""
 'This is gross. If Toyota buys tesla they will be sorely disappointed. How can they partner with bmw and gain access to some of the best manufacturing and engineering and then say this about tesla.'
 ""Please Toyota, don't follow thier path...""
 ""It's too bad that it looks like there is a giant iPad glued to the dashboard.  The big screens in the middle of the dash are an eyesore.""
 ""why aren't posts from random websites with no sources banned?"" 'Hmm yes'
 'So in other news, young car journalists discovered sarcasm.'
 'If you look at Toyotas EVs (like the BZ4X/Solterra) you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs very clearly built on an ICE car platform. The entire engine bay is occupied like an ICE car. You‚Äôd think Toyota would be able to build ANYTHING they want, they‚Äôre one of the biggest (if not the biggest) automakers on the planet. \n\nIt just sounds like Toyota is behind the curve on pure EVs.

That means you\'re paying $18,324 to get a car that costs $44,000 new, and then drive it for three years.\n\nDo you think a 3 year old one of these cars will be worth more than $25,676 when you\'re done with it? (Hint: they\'re selling 3 year old ones right now for $36,100.)\n\nAlso, this car has a $7,500 federal tax credit available. So, this is a car someone could buy for $44,000 and get $7,500 back in a tax refund next year - so, it will cost $36,500 for them to buy it. And then they can sell it in three years for $36,100; it will cost them $400 to have it for three years. \n\nOr, someone could lease it instead and pay $18,000 instead of $400 for the privilege.\n\nYou\'re damn right it\'s too good to be true. If you\'re the leasing company.'
 'Any sort of down-payment on a leased vehicle is a bad idea.'
 'Also don‚Äôt forget, never put money down on a lease!'
 'Too good to be true? You gotta put down $4500! Plus you gotta pay taxes and fees. To only keep it for 3 years. Idk'
 'I have a Model 3 and my wife has the RAV4. Tesla lease deals are awful due to no buyout option at the end. I would buy so you can get the tax credit and state rebate if your state offers it. Does your electric panel and service support 220V charging at home? I would not get an EV without a level 2 home charger'
 'No. $4,500 down for a lease is always a bad deal. A lease needs to be $0 down (or a low amount down) to be worth it.\n\nAlso a Tesla lease is not like a traditional lease, it‚Äôs more or a long term rental. At the end of a Tesla lease the vehicle must be returned, there is no option to buy the vehicle out for the residual value.'
 'Beware you can not sell Tesla leases. If you want to get out of the lease early, or have equity at the end, your options will be very very limited.'
 '4500 down plus u can‚Äôt buy out 3 or Y leases is bad'
 'Why you putting money down on a lease?'
 'Is that 12000 miles per year, or 12000 miles over 3 years?'
 'It sounds good because it seems like a low payment for an expensive car but it‚Äôs not as good as you may think.'
 'A leAse is a rental ,that‚Äôs why it sounds good'
 'Aren‚Äôt you unable to purchase the car after the lease?'
 ""Remember when Elon's mouth was used to increase the value of their cars?""
 'I‚Äôve never leased before, is that saying you can drive it for 12,000 miles (and then they start charging you for mileage over that) in 3 years? I drive that in less than a year.'
 'Paying close to $20k to have nothing after 3 short years sounds awful'
 ""Every $1000 down is about $30 to $35 per month. Depending on where you are, taxes probably add $25-$50 per month. Reg fees prob add $10/mo. Remove the downpayment, add in taxes and registration fees, and this is more like $600/mo.\n\nIs that a good deal? Probably not. If you can put down $7500 and roll taxes and fees into a 6 year loan at 5%, you'd be at about $615/mo. Then you'd get a $7500 check for tax credits to reimburse your downpayment. Toss that towards principal after a year and you'd be done in like 50 months total.\n\nOn the flip side, if you want to drive a Tesla and don't want to own a Tesla for more than 3 years and are concerned Elon might do something dumb to make them worthless (a non zero possibility) then it's the way to go.""
 'Any kind of lease is always usually a bad idea.'
 'All the people saying don‚Äôt put $1 down on a lease. Go ahead and find that deal anytime between now (real life) and 2018. Even then it wasn‚Äôt easy. I leased a vehicle in 2018. Income 100k+. Credit 820+. Still had to put 3-4k down on a 50k vehicle. Reddit becomes way too idealistic when it comes to real life shit. Please somebody, give me one real life example of putting 0 down on a vehicle nicer than a Toyota Camry.'

 'Bad quality low price simple as that.'
 ""Consider the miles and how you're going to use the car. 12,000 miles over three years would be very difficult for most people in the US to manage for something that isn't a second car. That's only about 300 miles a month and mileage penalties are no joke. And when you consider the mileage limitation, you're paying more than $1.50 per mile. Buying the car would be easy more cost effective if you can afford it.""
 'Do leases qualify for the 7500?'
 'Get a Toyota bro! To charge ur little car is going to take 1 hour'
 'So the biggest problem here is that they give you 12k miles for 3 YEARS. üòÇ most people drive 12-16k miles a year. A lot of people do 20k miles a year. So basically you would have to pay for the difference in those miles which can be astronomical. It would be closer to $1000 a month if you Add in the extra miles. So yeah this is üß¢'
 'You can see at the bottom of the photo 384 est month after 317 in ‚Äúpotential‚Äù gas savings. Your monthly payment is actually close to 700.'

 'If you wanna throw money away, this is an amazing deal.'
 ""Not bad! A better option, if you don't mind putting in a little work, is to find a 22 $100k+ MB EQS 450. Some folks are leasing it around $450 - $500 a month with very little down (less than $2k)""
 'I just saw one on fire on the highway. Sounds like a bad deal.'
 'Well you also arent buying it. So yeah it‚Äôs like renting a $40,000 object for three years.'
 'You‚Äôre putting 4500 down on a lease. That‚Äôs 4500 you will never get back. That‚Äôs an extra $125 if you divide 4500 by 36 months.'
 'RAV4 is gonna be built much better, more reliable, similarly priced and there‚Äôs tons of incentives for electric cars. Buy the RAV4'
 'Is 12,000 miles over 3 years fairly average for lease agreements? Seems very low.'
 'The problem with a model 3 lease is that you have no option to buy the car after your term. You have to return it. That alone is worth passing on the deal.'
 'Are you electrically equipped to charge it?  \n\nIf yes, proceed. \n\nIf no, figure out how much the hardware will cost you. \n\nI think Tesla does it‚Äôs own insurance thing because they monitor how you drive and collect your data, so it could be very affordable for you. \n\nThey are comparatively heavy, so basic consumables will go faster in general, but not the end of the world. \n\nThey don‚Äôt use real leather, but ‚Äúvegan leather‚Äù which is synthetic and petroleum based.\n\nThey do have a few issues with quality control, so check it over real good as some stupid things can go wrong. Apparently the Model Y is having difficulty with their steering wheels popping off, but I don‚Äôt know if this extends to the Model 3. \n\nRegardless, as long as you check it over like any other car, and are equipped to fuel/maintain it, you‚Äôll greatly enjoy it.'
 'Leasing is always a bad deal and I would never suggest it to anyone. Plenty of videos on that so not going into that. If you can afford it, buy it, otherwise think about getting a different car that is in your budget. Don‚Äôt overextend yourself especially now. If you care about the environment nothing is better then not having a car, yes even electric. E-bikes and transit is the better option, however most places besides mayor cities don‚Äôt have the infrastructure. If you don‚Äôt care to much stick with a regular gas car as they are still much more affordable.'
 'Toyota is a better buy because of federal Rebate if you get Rav4 Prime.  its like 7500$ off.'
 ""Also looks like you can only drove this 12k miles in 36 months...that's only ~350 miles a month.""
 'What is the point in leasing an expensive electric car, or a reliable base model Toyota that will run forever? If you drive so little that a lease works for you, just buy a reliable gas car. The gas is not going to be more expensive than what you lose in a lease. \n\nAnd if leasing, why go for something expensive and high quality like a base model Toyota? Get something cheap and American, pay less and have more features, and then give it back before the repairs start. \n\nOr just buy something.'
 ""Imagine buying an EV when they're brand new to reality and pricing.""

 ""You will own nothing and be happy. I'm so sick of this crap.""
 'Yes, I just put 16k down on a 51k car. Initial rates on a 60 mo were 7.5%‚Ä¶. I decided to do a 2.9% over 36mo instead‚Ä¶. My $1085/mo payment makes this look like a dream. 20/40/10 rule. \n\nBut honestly I just got out of a lease and not having any ‚Äúequity‚Äù in your vehicle sucks when you‚Äôre forced to get something else or buy it out at the end of the leasing period. I‚Äôd rather own now and drive it into the ground. Just my 2 cents.'

 ""This number is pretty or VERY accurate from my own experience.\n\nI leased my Model 3 about 2 weeks ago and the calculator was spot on. The only exception to this was Tax. Make sure to add sales take 10% (its 9.5 but still, in LA where I am) to the whatever lease total. My original calculator lease was 387$. Blue exterior + 19s + White interior. Add tax into the number and it sits around 430$. My actual lease price was 420-ish, which lines right up with the calculator considering the sales tax is 9.5 not 10.\n\nThis number really is too good to be true for Tesla, not to us consumers. My 2022 Audi Q5 is currently leased at 650 + tax so around 720 and that car's sticker price is only somewhat above what the Model 3 would be worth in cash.\n\nInclude things like maintenance plans and insurance for scuffs/damages (essentially a no questions asked return coverage) and I'm looking at having 2 Model 3s for 1 Q5 in terms of lease.\n\nIn general Teslas are not great to lease according to most people, especially since you can't buy the 3/Ys out (And Model S/X after certain date) and combine the fact that they hold so much value but I prefer driving a brand new car for my daily driver so my daily main car is always leased.""]"

That was more than 69% higher than the second best selling EV in Europe, the Dacia Spring with had 4,242 registrations in the same time period.\n\nWhile claiming the top spot and being that far ahead of the second place competitor is certainly an impressive accomplishment by itself, it is even more impressive when you compare the starting price of the top two EVs. Prices obviously vary by country across Europe, but taking Germany as an example, the two most popular variants of the Model Y start at ‚Ç¨44,890 for the Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) version and ‚Ç¨54,990 for the Long Range.\n\nThat is more than double the price of the Dacia Spring, which starts at ‚Ç¨20,490.\n\nRounding out the top five best selling EVs in Europe in January were the VW ID.4 (3,832), VW ID.3 (3,348), and the Fiat 500 (3,248). (via InsideEVs)'
 ""Tesla is building and shipping 5800 cars per day. around the world. it will take a long time for everybody to catch up. because this is they're starting point and they're going straight up. Mexico is going to open. gigafactory Nevada is going to pick up. semi trucks are coming. cybertruck coming. and don't forget about the power packs power walls around the world. Tesla's a class act.\nyou might not like Elon musk but guess what the mother fucker knows what he's doing.""
 'Well, just wait until the established automakers starts making EVs!'
 'Not taking ANYTHING away from Tesla because they have executed on all fronts extremely well and still have a commanding lead but ""Top Selling"" could easily be replaced with ""Most Readily Available"" EV in almost any local - at least here in the states.  \n\nThe 65 closest Ford dealers to me only have a total of 61 Mach E\'s in various states of inventory or in transit.  The local KIA dealer has 1 EV6 GT marked with a $6,500 market adjustment.  The 2 others have none.  Try finding a Lightning at your local dealer.  \n\nIf Hyundai were to wave a magic wand and could build enough Ionic 6\'s to have 15-20 at every dealer I guarantee it would be a different story.  As long as everyone else continues to play catch-up and fails to deliver even a fraction of demand, these numbers will continue to be in Tesla\'s favor.'
 'It‚Äôll be the top selling car before this year is over.'
 ""Here in Germany, they are everywhere now. When we took delivery, the Model Y was still kind of a rare sight and people - especially kids - waved at us all the time. \n\nNow there are 3 or 4 just in my tiny, super conservative neighborhood. It's insane.""

 ""From the article: A tree fell and crushed a Tesla Model 3 during a recent storm in California. While the car is severely damaged, both passengers who were in the electric car are expected to be okay.\n\nThis isn't the first time we've seen a report of a tree falling on a Tesla, and the previous stories also celebrated the EV for saving the people inside. While Tesla has been under much scrutiny for years for the quality and fit and finish of its vehicles, there's no doubt they're built to take abuse and keep people safe.\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 is designated as a Top Safety Pick+ by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), which is the organization's highest honor. It means not only did the EV get the top score in all crash tests, but also the top ratings for its crash avoidance and mitigation systems, which come standard.\n\nTesla is also often under investigation for its advanced driver-assist systems, Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot, and Full Self-Driving Beta Capability. People are concerned that Tesla tests the systems on public roads with little restriction, though the technologies have been shown to limit accidents and injuries, much like similar technologies found in rival vehicles.\n\nAt any rate, according to the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office, a Tesla Model 3 Performance was traveling on Old Honda Road near Skyline Boulevard in Portola Valley, California, when a tree fell in front of it and crushed the front end and windshield.""

 'I\'ve had this happen before a couple times in my many years of driving, thankfully i also always press the clutch pedal at the same time - all i got was loud revving and a dawning realization that i almost fucked up.\n\nElectric cars have no clutch pedal so if this would happen on an electric can i would\'ve definitely crash through someone\'s kitchen.\n\nI think electric cars need to have a clutch pedal, but for a different purpose:\n\n* Completely disable all acceleration when touching the pedal regardless of what the accelerator is doing.\n* Pressing the pedal would increase regen break, and drivers would naturally learn to use this pedal to minimise use of disc brakes.\n* The above functionality can be reversed with a toggle, allowing this ""clutch pedal"" to gradually decrease regen brake power, allowing the car to coast thus mimicking combustion engine behaviour.\n* Option: if the accelerator was engaged when this pedal is touched, the accelerator must be completely disengaged in order for it to start working again. This is to avoid degenerate behaviour of throttling both pedals back and forth to modulate motor power. Might be an interesting setting to disable in Track Mode.\n\nOverall, this is obviously a skill issue, learn to drive, get better training, yada-yada-yada. But at the end of the day we\'re all human and no matter how skilled you are all it takes is ONE oopsie to screw up your entire life.\n\nCombustion engines have clutch pedals that, i hope, we\'re all trained to press alongside the brake pedal when we want to decelerate, so even if we somehow screw up the brake we still got the clutch disengaged and not sending the car into a wall or, God forbid, another person.\n\nWe can repurpose this pedal that everyone already knows how to use into something useful and an additional failsafe.\n\nAnd before you argue ""self driving cars hurr durr"" - they\'re not coming any time soon, until i can legally fall asleep in my car and it can take me into my garage on its own across the country with no driver i don\'t care about any of those arguments - when we get there we can remove it, it\'s easy to remove things.'
 'One pedal drive makes you think accelerator is brake. This happened to me MANY times in my Model 3. I now set regen to low and always make an effort to apply SOME pressure on the brakes so I keep that muscle memory.'
 'This is a bad headline. The article states the police investigation isn‚Äôt over so yah tsla investigated itself‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs like police departments investigating themselves too.\n\n100% accelerator?

 'This happens a lot with ICE vehicles. In the early 90s there was a huge investigation after someone plowed into a mall. The finding was that it was all driver error. They even tested and prove that it was not possible to drive a car with both pedals depressed. That braking power always overrode accelartor. One recommendation for some vehicles was the brake pedal to align more with the steering column as driver when mashing the brake expects it to be right below the steering wheel center.']"

 'I think the most important things is the battery life. According to google most of them last about 1500 cycles.

 'With regards to the discussion about battery life herein: It‚Äôs not how many km‚Äôs the car has travelled per se, but more importantly, how the battery was utilised.\n\nConstantly deep cycling the battery and recharging after prolonged periods at the discharge stage will cause the battery life to diminish much quicker.\n\nCruising range of this model is ~490km but city driving brings this down to ~350km. Assuming a mix of this then average range is ~ 420km. It currently has 163,000km on the clock so it would of had ~390 full recharge by now if it were deep cycled. That is a lot for two years, because battery is deemed to provide 1500 cycles and about 20-30years of drivability. The car has not only lost more drivability life but is out of warranty because it‚Äôs gone past 160k or 4 years (the warranty bit not 100% certain so correct me if I‚Äôm wrong).\n\nEither way it‚Äôs a gamble I would not risk.'

 ""The actual motors and mechanics are probably still fine cause electric cars are so mechanically simple that they really don't wear out the same way a combustion car does.\n\nThe battery however will be loosing its juice and need a replacement, unfortunately tesla doesn't recycle or replace the batteries, so although it's a perfectly fine car you can't buy one with that many K's cause it's dead, a real shame Elon decided to go down that route as lithium batteries can be recycled to create more batteries (and they'd have the same performance as a freshly mined lithium battery as it's not the lithium that dies when you use a lithium battery) which is an especially lucrative business when lithium deposits are running so incredibly low right now.\n\nHonestly as far as EV'a go, the Polestar is the best, it uses both an induction motor and a PMSYNRM motor to create an (almost) variable area of flux motor which means the top model with an induction motor up front and a PMSYNRM motor in the rear can make it's advertised range (within a small margin of error of course, much like a petrol car) in almost any environment regardless of speed, luggage, and how hilly the roads are or how bad the traffic is, unlike the Teslas which can only make their advertised range doing 20kph downhill because Elon is too dumb to understand the benefits and drawbacks of PMSYNRM motors in comparison to induction motors and BLDC motors and as such the teslas he produces always fall short of their claims.""

They should have lightly touched the wheel, brake, or accelerator and FSD would have turned off immediately and prevented this. Additionally many of the drivers involved were either traveling too quickly for conditions or not paying attention.

 'From the article: Jonathan Zoes, an aspiring filmmaker, has become the first person to drive an electric vehicle to the Arctic Ocean in -40¬∞C (-40¬∞F) temperatures of an Arctic winter, and he did it in a Tesla Model Y. Zoes documented his journey driving through Canada to Tuktoyaktuk, relying on the help of strangers to plug in the vehicle once charging stations became harder to find.\n\nIn an interview with Northern News Services Limited, Zoes stated that finding charging stations was easy in the southern part of his drive. However, as he made his way to Dawson Creek in Northern British Columbia, he had to rely on RV parks to keep his vehicle charged.\n\nThe Yukon territory has been constructing fast charging stations at an impressive rate, even surpassing the adoption rate of electric vehicles among locals. Consequently, Zoes found most of the charging stations empty after passing Whitehorse.\n\nZoes couldn‚Äôt always rely on finding public chargers however. An Indigenous council in Profit River let him use their maintenance building for the night to charge up. To cross the Dempster Highway, which has no gas stations for more than 300 kilometres, he befriended road crews who let him use their garages. In Fort McPherson, he was able to get another charge from LJ‚Äôs Contracting. To travel the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktyuk Highway, he improvised a charging station.'
 ""What kind of ranges was he getting up there from a charge, and how long did he have to charge it on other people's electricity.  I'm guessing they didn't have wall charges mounted, and he's relying on the mobile connector ~3kW/hr charge rate?""

 'In all cars today, whether gas, diesel, or battery, the accel pedal is just an ""electronic request"".  In olden days (until \\~2010), the accel pedal was directly actuated either a cable or rod which controlled either a throttle plate in the inlet or an injection pump.  The electronic signal can get corrupted or read wrong in software.  In early systems in gas cars, the throttle plate was moved directly (via motor) in synch with the accel pedal, but not sure that is still true today, such as the controller may lift up the throttle during transmission shifts.\n\nTesla\'s response has typically been ""the log shows the accel pedal was pressed"", but that doesn\'t mean the driver pressed the pedal or that it was even depressed.  In one posted case, the data from a Tesla showed the pedal being depressed and lifted 10 times per sec, which a human driver couldn\'t do, looking more like either electronic glitches or incorrect software reading of bytes.'

Solche M√§ngel treten bei allen untersuchten E-Autos √ºberdurchschnittlich h√§ufig auf, erkl√§rt Joachim B√ºhler, Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer des T√úV-Verbands. ""Ein Grund daf√ºr ist die Rekuperation, mit der in E-Autos Bremsenergie zur√ºckgewonnen wird. Sie entlastet die Bremsen, was abh√§ngig von der Fahrweise zum \'Einschlafen der Bremsbel√§ge\' (Absenkung des Reibwertes) f√ºhren kann."" Daher sollten E-Auto-Fahrende regelm√§√üig kr√§ftig bremsen, um die Bremsbel√§ge wieder zu regenerieren und damit die volle Bremsleistung zu erhalten.\n\nVielleicht kommt es ja noch, dass einen das Auto daran erinnert. Ist ja kein Problem aber ich w√ºrde definitiv vergessen einmal im Monat (oder in der Woche?) scharf zu bremsen.'

 'Die die jetzt √ºber den T√úV m√ºssen, sind ja fr√ºhe Modelljahre, und die wurden bekannterma√üen schlecht in den USA zusammengedengelt. W√ºrde mich interessieren, wie es bei den aktuellen Modellen aus China und Deutschland ausschaut, in der Produktion sind die deutlich besser. An billigen Lagern √§ndert das nat√ºrlich nix.\n\nIch bin mal gespannt, wie die Statistik in 2-3 Jahren aussieht.'
 'Amis k√∂nnen keine Autos bauen, die westlichen Standards entsprechen. √úberraschung.'
 'Mein ehemaliger Golf Hybrid war da auch nicht besser. Nach zwei Jahren waren hinten die Scheiben wegen nicht-Benutzung total vergammelt.'
 'Und der Polestar z.B. sieht auch noch wesentlich geiler aus, wenn einem Posing wichtig ist.\n\nAnsonsten gibt es ja kaum noch vern√ºnftige Gr√ºnde, ausgerechnet ein Musk-Mobil zu kaufen.'
 'Bei einem Auto welches nicht in einen teuren j√§hrlichen Service muss sammeln sich nat√ºrlich kleinere M√§ngel z.B. bei der Beleuchtung an, die dann eben vom T√úV entdeckt werden. Das ist praktisch eine Verlagern der Pr√ºfarbeit und f√ºr den Halter eine angenehme Sache.'

 ""I work in this field. But because my job is so polarizing on Reddit, I will leave it at that.\n\nOn a typical shift we average somewhere between 80-130 miles. And burn through about 9-11 gallons of fuel. We buy fuel in bulk and fill up at the fleet office.\n\nMy agency was able to buy around 400 Ford Explorers during our last bid for about $24k a piece.

Most cars are still running just fine but are typically on a new engine and on their third transmission. At that mileage however, the interiors and structural components are very destroyed. Lots of interior trim is broken or missing. The cars rattle like crazy and suspensions are clunky and terrible. \n\nBecause of the wear and tear alone I couldn't imagine driving a ten year old patrol vehicle as aggressively as is sometimes done.

 'California has the same deal, but you have to game your income across multiple years to make it fully work.  State related credit requires low income.  Federal rebate requires enough tax liability.'
 'Kind of misleading. \n\nTo get the 5k charge ahead credit you need to drop below a pretty low income threshold. Based on household size. 54k individual, 73k for a couple, 92k for three. \n\nAt those rates you‚Äôre not going to have $7,500 in taxes to claim the credit against to begin with.'

 'I have this exact model / color on order - it looks fantastic in your photos - enjoy!'
 'oh my lord....one more month one more month...'
 'Here is my review of the 2023 Tesla Model 3 Performance! As a Tesla and EV enthusiast, I have been eagerly waiting to get my hands on this electric beast, and I\'m thrilled to share my thoughts with you.\n\nFirstly, let\'s talk about the pros of this car. The panel gaps are excellent, and the paint job is flawless, making the car look incredibly sleek and modern. The car arrived clean and well-maintained upon delivery, which is always a good sign. The speed and handling of the car are out of this world, and the upgraded suspension compared to the Model Y Long Range is noticeable, making for a smoother and more comfortable ride. The audio system is top-notch, and there are no rattling noises while driving, which indicates that the car is tightly constructed and built to last.\n\nI opted for the Metallic Silver Metal color and black interior, and I have to say, it looks stunning. The silver gives the car a modern and sophisticated look, while the black interior adds to the car\'s sporty and sleek appearance. I\'ve owned a Model Y with white seats before, but the black seats in the Model 3 feel more plush and comfortable, which is a significant improvement. The wood trim took some time to get used to, but now I see the Model 3 as the ""executive"" car, as it feels so premium and well-designed.\n\nNot sure what they did to the cameras, but they are much higher quality than my 2022 Model Y Long Range. Could be the snappier AMD chip but they look great on screen. HW4? \U0001f979üëâüèªüëàüèª\n\nAs for the cons, there are only a few minor issues that I have encountered. The glovebox is a bit finicky, and the headlights don\'t fit perfectly, but these are easy fixes that can be taken care of with an at-home service appointment. Additionally, the car is low to the ground, which might take some getting used to if you\'re used to driving larger vehicles, but it\'s not a significant issue.\n\nOverall, I\'m impressed with the 2023 Tesla Model 3 Performance. The car\'s impressive speed, handling, and audio system, combined with its sleek appearance, make it a top contender in the electric car market. Despite a few minor issues, the car is well-built and well-designed, making it a great investment for any car enthusiast looking for a high-quality electric car. If you\'re considering buying a Model 3, I highly recommend taking a closer look at these options to elevate your driving experience even further.'
 'Your paintwork looks extra shiny. Ceramic Coated?' 'Sharp'
 'I got the exact same color scheme and model last month. Only 5 weeks old with 700 miles but I‚Äôm liking the car enough to say I wish it lasts me 8 years'
 ""I really want to commit to ordering this same spec. Love the white but have already owned 1 black, 1 blue, and 2 white vehicles. I'm over the few initial hesitancies I had towards going EV after learning more about them. Now I'm hung up on waiting out for HW4 and the *very much rumored* model 3 refresh. I know at some point even those will become the *older* models, but I always go for the next best thing. Maybe I shouldn't worry about that and just do it lol""
 'Gorgeous car!'
 ""Nice, I've read that some of the newer models have a larger battery pack and come with the 20 inch standard rims, head to head the model right before those improvements (I think 2019) is a bit lighter/quicker.\n\nReferring only to the M3P, what I read I believe compared the 2023 to the 2019(stealth) models\n\nMind you difference is negligible as it's about 0.1s difference if that data is to be believed.""

 'hey we are brothers, same color and performance edition! I went to order 2 weeks ago and they had one in stock in Dallas (I live in Austin) so I committed on 3/3. Sold my 2020 hybrid accord on 3/10 and picked up on 3/11 then had a blast driving back to austin. i actually didnt plan on getting the white interior (I swear they hid that on the in stock part) but its growing on me for sure. My heart sunk on pick up, but it looks super classy and nice so I am going to stick with it, I love the car too much! I found the ""leather"" to be pretty nice and soft, exactly what i would expect. \n\nI am doing full PPF front end and back bumper, I am also adding rockers. I havent decided just yet on tint but leaning towards 15% on all doors and back window, and then since I am in Texas I will be doing the front windshield with the respective tint there too.

 'If this isnt a red flag for you, i dont know what is'
 'Same happened to me.  Got an estimate of $21K.. placed a deposit on new Model Y.  Less than a week later time to pick up Model Y and suddenly my final estimate for my trade in has dropped to $19K.   Couldn‚Äôt speak with anyone over the phone except my SA who said ‚Äúhe had nothing to do that department‚Äù.  Got so angry was ready to walk away completely.  \n\nEnded up refusing the trade.  Taking delivery of the Y.. and keeping my old car.  Immediately listed it on Facebook marketplace where a local Honda dealer bought it for $23K.. or about $4K higher than Teslas highest offer!   \n\nYou always hear the Cult talk about they love buying a new Tesla because dealerships play too many games.   And while that is true.. Teslas plays even worst games.  There is simply no excuse for giving a trade estimate.. when the final offer can change by several thousands of dollars even a day later.   Carmax and others have given trade in quotes in writing.. that are good for 7 days.   As you can imagine I would never trade in another vehicle to Tesla.  They are shady as fuck.'
 ""Look at it this way, you have only cheated yourself of 250 and you have not fallen into buying that pile of crap that is the Model Y. \n\nGet over it and don't buy anything that comes from Tesla etc. They are shit cars, with shit customer service. With one of the most toxic communities of fanboys. (You already knew this shortly after you investigated, so you already knew where you were getting into, It can't surprise you).""
 'So sell it to carmax.'
 'Sell your used car private party.  Trade-ins are generally a rip -off'
 ""You could maybe sue Tesla and hope you get your $250 back plus costs and damages.\n\nIn my opinion you're better off just forgetting Tesla, and getting a Hyundai IONIQ 5 or a Kia EV 6 or a VW ID4 or a Ford Mustand Mach-E or an Audi e-tron. In my opinion, with any of those, you'll be getting a better car. Some people would debate that.\n\nBut no reasonable person can deny that you'd be dealing with a better company if you got something other than Tesla. And that $250 is just the beginning. Just wait until that Model Y needs a repair -- which might not be a long wait, given Tesla's quality-control problems. When a Tesla needs to be repaired, that's when they REALLY begin to fuck you over.""
 'I was very interested in buying a model Y because of the tax rebate. I wanted to see the fees and taxes on the car before deciding on which car to buy. I went to the website and spec the car I wanted and before showing me anything about final fees and taxes, they stopped me at the $250 deposit. I wonder how many people have forfeited this $250 ü§î.  I went with a different car. For the price of the Y there is so many other cars and the interior is inferior to everything else.'
 'Same happened to me, just not quite as extreme.\n\nFirst offer was $3k under the estimate, so I rejected it and resubmitted. Second offer came in $500 higher, so I accepted then later rejected as the delivery date approached. Third offer came in $1500 higher so I called it good enough.'
 'Just sell your old car yourself. It‚Äôs not that difficult. I financed 100% on my model 3 and sold my car privately. I‚Äôll use the old car money to pay down the principal on the Tesla.'
 ""Tesla doesn't do anything with the trade unless it's another Tesla.  Their offer is an estimate of what the car will bring at an auto auction.  Unless you just don't care all the data indicates it's better to sell your car elsewhere than to accept the Tesla trade in offer.""
 'I don\'t see the problem, apart from you not having read / understood the process.\n\nOnce you have done a predeposit, you can ask for a trade-in.  Not vice-versa.   Ordering a car at 250 $ predeposit is one thing. Asking a trade-in offer is another process.  \n\nYou are free to cancel the Tesla trade-in offer.  \n\nAs you are free cancel your Tesla order.\n\nTry this with any other ""fraud dealer"".'
 'My trade in value was smack dead in the middle of their estimate. And I ran the trade in within the 7 day estimate window that I got. Estimate says good for 7 days while the final says good for 30. \n\nI know one of my buddies did it and his offer was lower than estimate bc he had an accident on the history and I‚Äôve also heard the estimate doesn‚Äôt run your vin, while the offer does. \n\nThis can bring up accident history, see if the car was a rental etc. basically run a carfax. \n\nGive them a call or stop by a local store and they can tell you why.'

 'It‚Äôs really hard to pass on for the new price point compared to other EVs.'
 ""Tesla had two new factories ramping up in 2022, both of them just making the Model Y. Their production at the end of 2022 was way higher than at the beginning. \n\nOver the year on average Toyota was selling about 95k Corollas a month, but they had a few really good sales months this spring, and then volume was down the rest of the year (at least based on US sales which are roughly 20-25% of all sales). \n\nAt the beginning of the year Tesla's Model Y production from Freemont and Shanghai was probably averaging at least 55k per month, but by the end of the year both Austin and Berlin were probably doing around 3k/week or 12kish a month. So maybe a 80k/month rate at the end of the year. \n\nIt's pretty likely that on a monthly basis the Model Y started off outside the top 10 best selling cars, but by the end of the year it was either 1 or 2 in the world, and averaged out to #4 for the whole year. And just because models from every manufacturer aren't evenly distrusted everywhere, the Model Y ended up being the best selling car overall in some markets.\n\nBut both Berlin and Austin are still ramping up, they're both targeted to increase production by another 100k a year or so. Global production will likely be well over 1 million this year, and could easily be the best selling car of the year. In fact, when volumes start to get up towards the 1.2 to 1.3 million ranger we're talking about one of the best selling modern cars of all time. What's really amazing is that at the start of 2019 the Model Y wasn't even in production yet. In less than 5 years it could go from zero sales per year to the best selling car of the year, potentially one of the best selling cars ever made.""

 ""There was a greek architect, Mesodides, that submitted plans to build a temple to the Committee on Building Greek Temples. The committee said it was unsound and needed more columns.

So Mesodides added the columns, but he never connected them to the roof -- the were functionally useless. That temple? The Acropolis of Athens. \n\nMusk is just a modern day Mesodides. People say FSD doesn't work, that it will kill people. Musk disagrees. The government tells him he can't sell a car that is FSD, that it must have a steering wheel for a driver to manipulate.

 'I think he\'s basing this on the fact that the roadster had the ability and wasn\'t used... but we are in a very different time in terms of EVs and solar adoption. \n\nWhile I wouldn\'t buy the car solely for this reason, I certainly wouldn\'t hate the option. Los Angeles area just had tens of thousands without power, some for days. With solar supplementing, a tesla battery could easily power a house for days, if not ""forever"" with solar supplementing the consumption. Here in MA I can almost live even in the winter with just my solar array and two power walls.'
 ""Well no shit it won't be widespread. It's not like I regularly have a need to power my house with batteries.

Hell yes, I will absolutely use the car to power the house. And when I go to buy my next vehicle, which will certainly be electric, bi-directional charging will be a MAJOR factor.  \n\nIt's not about using this feature all the time, it's about having this feature when you really need it.""
 'VTG is not difficult.  Ford managed to pull it off quickly.  All it needs is an Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) and a large inverter.  Tesla already has an ATS called the Tesla Gateway.  It is used on all Powerwall installations to automatically cut off the electrical connection to the grid which is required by law when you are sending your own power onto your local house circuits and have the potential to back-feed power into the grid while while the grid is down.  Tesla already has a large inverter.  It is installed as part of Tesla solar or one is built-into the Powerwall 2.  This means that they already make and sell most of the components to enable this.\n\nThe easiest way for Tesla to do this would be to require that the location already have the gateway and at least one Powerwall.  It would then add a DC input from the car charger to the Powerwall battery using a DC to DC converter that the Powerwall could enable for up to 5kW per Powerwall or DC to AC in the Tesla solar inverter when the Powerwalls get to low charge and the car is at high charge.  That would require minimal changes to the Powerwall, to the car charger, and to the car to feed power backwards when enabled.  If the power was to be sent to the grid, the Powerwall would do that just like it does it today with the Tesla virtual powerplant.  A few software changes for the config to be enabled or disabled and the charge levels to activate and deactivate it and its all done.'
 'The challenge isn‚Äôt the cars, the challenge is that V2G costs a fortune to install - $3-4k more than a standard car charger installed, because it requires major electrical work on top of the high cost of bidirectional chargers. Plus of course the drawback that you lose power when you go for a drive.'

 ""I'm confused why they would claim that unplugging your car would turn off electricity in your house. is this some weird American thing? the battery systems i know of in Europe work while your house is grid connected, and simply supply enough power so you don't pull anything from the grid. turning that off would not be noticable, as any load will simply pull from the grid instead of the batter.""
 ""They won't offer it until forced by competition\n\n\nPowerwall will die instantly""

 'I have to agree with Elon, bidirectional charging for the most part is pretty stupid.   Usually when you need backup power at home you also need your vehicle to work.   In fact if the power outage is the result of natural disasters you will need that vehicle to clear the area or to help with getting facilities back on line.   In fact it is during these outages when the ability to charge from a home backup system become important.\n\nSo yeah pretty stupid.'

 'For us it would make sense without a powerwall as well, just as a backup power source in case of a hurricane. Even without solar this is great to have. I would buy a generator or a powerwall but the cost is high and already have electric cars purchased.'
 ""It's a cool feature. But it mutes the resale confidence on battery use in comparison to mileage. Each discharge that isn't driving is still equivalent to adding mileage to the battery pack. \n\nI don't think you can have a million mile Tesla and use your Tesla as a power plant.""

 'Does a home need special wiring to be able to accept the reverse power‚Ä¶.clearly i know nothing about electrical'
 ""At the moment, the home L2 charger is a pretty simple piece of equipment. If you want to power your home from the car,  you'd have to, at very least, install a transfer box that breaks the connection to the grid when you switch to having the car powering the house.\n\nThis is so that you don't energize the network outside your house; doing so while repairs are underway is incredibly dangerous to the workers trying to fix downed wires.\n\nGoing the full V2G route, with your car battery part of the network power backup, is\nfar more complex, and would require a 'gateway' in your house, similar to that used by solar-to-grid systems, to manage load and connection. This runs into money.""
 'Sidenote, there will be millions of people going to free charging stations and then sending the power back to their house/grid just to save a few bucks a day'
 'Oh man, Elon‚Äôs reply is just so out of touch with reality. He sounds like a guy who‚Äôs never experienced a power outage before. \n\nOh no!  I can‚Äôt drive (one of) my cars without inconveniencing my house. As if that‚Äôs remotely comparable to not being able to stay warm, boil water, have lights and keep a fridge cold when it‚Äôs parked there. At least give people the option. And I‚Äôm guessing most household that own Teslas have more than one car. And even then power outages happen at night time, during holidays, on weekends, and other times, when you don‚Äôt necessarily have to drive fairly often. Oh yeah, and I can always walk or ride a bike. \n\nComparing the level of convenience gained by using your already purchased Tesla to buying multiple power walls with solar for $50,000 is just ridiculous.\n\nIf Tesla doesn‚Äôt jump on this soon I‚Äôm sure every other auto manufacturer will. That‚Äôs a huge increased value for your cars. Whether or not Tesla wants to cannibalize a bit of the power wall market, they really won‚Äôt have a choice and will have to offer this in the future if anyone else does before them anyway.'
 'Clown, should have enabled this by default. Especially if you look at all the congestie networks in Europe. For true sustainability every car by law should be bi directional charging with x% of the battery dedicated for imbalances in the grid. Which should be compensated by for lower taxes (i mean in Europe we are already givjng them a ton of freebies).'

 'Under one of those covered products is the next gen powerwall'
 ""It's more complicated than just pluging your car into the house and turning it on. Batteries are generally setup to handle specific loads, not just anything that needs power. You also have to have inverters that convert the power needed, these are generally sized to handle the specific loads you're trying to offset. So while the functionality may exist, I totally see his point that most people won't invest in the infastructure neede to make it work. Guessing those that already have solar (along with inverters and batteries) may a get a lot more use out of this feature.""
 'retrofit?'
 ""So for background, we have 2 Teslas, 8 kw solar system (Enphase), 30kwh storage (Enphase LFP). \n\nI think all this talk about di-direction charging is way simplified by people like Elon and tech articles. The reality of things is that in order to be able to do this, home infrastructure needs some major changes in 99% of cases. When we installed our battery backup system, I couldn't believe the number of sub-panels, smart switches, battery disconnects, etc that we had to install not to mention main panel upgrades (even though we had 220 amp already). Also the sheer number of inspections that we had to do was astounding. If you think about it, it makes sense because while in our minds it sounds simple (ie when sun is shining, power first goes to home use, then to charge the battery, then to charge the car, when power is down, start using battery and go off grid but still take in power from the panels to the battery when offgrid), it is actually very complicated to direct electricity that way while taking into account the safety of line workers during an outage. Even after its said and done, our system can't direct electricity from solar to the battery AND the house at the same time, so in the morning when our batteries are down to 30% from a night of offgrid power (I switch to battery 100% when sun goes down), the panels charge the batteries but if you use appliances, the power has to come from the grid because there's no way to direct certain watts to the battery while also sending some to appliances. So if you think Tesla is just gonna flip a swtich and make their vehicles capable of V2H, its not gonna be simple at all to make your house ready to take that power. Another issue is that there isn't a standardize way that I am aware of to set this system up, it seems like every home battery company is doing their own thing with their own gateway etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother problem with V2H is the sheer inefficiency of it all. Power is generated as DC current across the panel and inverted to AC for home use (in my case Microinverters which inverts at the panel). When charging the car, the car's internal charger inverts the AC back to DC for storage in the battery. Then if you use V2H, the power has to come out of the battery and inverted again for Home use (DC to AC). Now imagine if this is going on all day with small losses every time there is an inversion. Home batteries are even worse sometimes because I will stored solar power during the (DC to AC to DC) then charge the car with the electricity at night (DC to AC to DC).""

What is your message?\n\nAnd please, use your words, Elon.\n\ne.g. Are you saying that even those of us who don\'t like billionaires such as yourself are in truth actually people who say we don\'t like billionaires but will nevertheless happily suck on the exact same boot of the billionaire upper class if the exact same boot is decorated/disguised/labelled to suit our specific boot-sucking taste?  Are you the real Soros?  Is the boot actually yours but you\'ve made it look like Soros\' boot to make people suck on it?  Are you saying there\'s some other oppressive force/boot with your name on it, and then your name is replaced on the boot by ""Soros ""and the cartoon anti-billionaire character either gladly sucks on the boot or is kicked in the mush by the billionaire boot...\n\ni.e.  In other words, are you saying that you believe that you billionaires have a beyond perverse level and amount of wealth and influence over humanity as a whole and need to have your...  legs and power broken, and/or...\n\nWhat?\n\nWhat the fuck are you actually getting at?'

It handles better. \n\nThe highlander is built by a company that knows how to build cars. In 21 they were pretty special but the market has aligned against it. \n\nFor the money the highlander is the easy choice. If you want fast there‚Äôs a Tesla. However, you must know the Tesla range claims are hyper inflated.'

 'This is a weird pair to directly compare, along with a pretty wide price difference. \n\nThe Highlander is reliable and capable, although incredibly boring. $66k for a family carrying appliance seems steep. \n\nThe Y is much more interesting and quick. You‚Äôll never call it boring, although some think the interior can be lacking in luxury, especially when considering the price tag. There are many options in that price range that will offer much more luxury. \n\nIt‚Äôs would be a deal breaker for me if I didn‚Äôt have a home charger.'
 'Probably the highlander. They have great build quality, nice interiors, last forever, cheap (comparatively) to repair/service, toyota as a whole is a better company to deal with. As for preference, I learned how to drive with a highlander, and I enjoyed how it drove. However, 66k is a lot for a highlander, my parents got theirs for 35k, a price point that makes it a solid deal. For that much money, you could get a luxury SUV like a BMW, which has a lot of really nice small features and touches here and there that make the driving experience far better, \n\nBetween the two, I would choose the highlander, but for the price, you could definitely do a lot better than both IMO.'

 ""If the 81k for the Model Y is solidly in your budget, I'd recommend looking for an Acura or Lexus equivalent to the Highlander. If 81k is more of a stretch, I'd recommend checking out Mazda's SUV offerings if you haven't already. I'm a bit biased because I'm a big Mazda fan, but I genuinely think they make great cars. The Model Y comes with all the typical Tesla problems, but the Highlander isn't a stellar vehicle either.\n\nMy mechanic had a hybrid Highlander for a while and the hybrid system was surprisingly unreliable - this may be irrelevant if you're looking at a non-hybrid, but I'd definitely stay away from the hybrid. He also complained about interior quality, and specifically called it out as substantially worse than a similar (but cheaper) Hyundai. That being said, I can't recommend a Hyundai with all the engine issues they've had. Even if you get a car with a good engine, the dealership techs will always be busy doing engine replacements for other customers.""
 ""Just saying, 66k for a highlander is insane, if you have ever been in other vehicles in the same price range (especially from premium brand), you will know what I'm talking about, Highlander is miles behind in terms of NVH, driving dynamic, material quality, etc, don't get me wrong, it's a great car, but it's not $66k great, regardless of the trim level.""

 '$66k, for a highlander?!?'
 'If the Highlander is a good fit for what you want, the Model Y will be a bad fit. The Highlander is a size bigger, both for cargo and rear passengers - and it can have an actual third row, which the Model Y says it can have but really can‚Äôt.\n\nAnd if you really want to drop top dollar for all the options and top trim on a family hauler why are you getting a Highlander? Just go up to the Lexus or a Porsche Cayenne like the other prep school moms.\n\nIf you want to spend money on more fun the Model Y makes more sense but the Highlander is a weird choice for that.'
 'Honestly in my opinion, it depends where you do the most driving. \n\nIf you‚Äôre in a city centre like London or New York most of the time and can easily charge it, you‚Äôd be stupid not to get a Tesla or another EV - alternates can include the Jaguar I-Pace or Fiat 500E or whatever else catches your eye. In congested cities, EVs are wonderful things. And I may added this is coming from a diehard petrol head - if anything I‚Äôm biased against electric vehicles. \n\nBut if you‚Äôre predominantly in suburban or country driving, the Toyota or other petroleum powered cars are generally a better long term proposition.'

 'Is this Canadian?  The highlander and Tesla shouldn‚Äôt be near that high.'
 'In this specific comparison you are looking at, Highlander Platinum'
 ""I definitely wouldn't go for the Tesla. The Highlander is decent on all counts, but for Tesla money you can get the Polestar SUV, which is all-electric, MUCH more interesting and probably beats the Tesla in most metrics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI saw someone suggest the Mazda CX90, which looks hella cool.  Probably better value than the Highlander and more interesting, but 1st year for a new model with an all new engine and hybrid drivetrain... eh.  that's a pretty big risk in my opinion.  \n\n\nI really don't understand how why the hell they chose to put an inline six into it.  I mean, I love BMWs and their inline sixes, but the market is moving fast toward electrification, and putting a chonky (probably awesome) engine into a hybrid is kind of contradictory and weird to me.""

Since there's an applicable MSRP limit of $55,000 for electric cars and $80,000 MSRP limit for electric SUVs, trucks and vans, the Tesla Model S sedan and Model X SUV are not eligible for the $7,500 tax credit. That's because the Model S starts at around $105,000 and the Model X is priced from approximately $121,000. \n\nWhile that was expected, the fact that other Tesla models are overlooked comes as a surprise for many.

All it will do is force manufacturers to change the stated GVWR for 2024 to be greater than 6000lbs whether it is or not.

The tesla build is okay but not in same class as bmw Audi merc Lexus. One aspect I think that‚Äôs important is that for a car, it‚Äôs great - handles well, is fun to drive and powertrain is incredible. The main negative for me is technology not being what you‚Äôd expect and that it‚Äôs really embarrassing driving something so closely linked to Elon.

If you\'re stupid enough to take your eyes off the road in a situation that would put you in danger then you probably shouldn\'t be driving full stop. For those of us who *actually* live with them, I can adjust the temperature when stationary (seriously how often do you do this when going down a winding road anyway!?) Or use voice commands. Either works great.\n\nThere\'s a lot of misinformed nonsense surrounding Tesla\'s online and it\'s strange how polarising of an issue it is. I literally chose mine because it was both the fastest and cheapest company car I could get. \n\nBut to sit and read countless commentary online about ""meh, build kwality"" or ""eh, no HUD"" from inexperienced people who themselves drive something slower, more technology-depraved old crappy cars is absolutely mind-blowing to me. Yes, your clattery 2.0 diesel BMW is really the pinnacle of a driving experience, you absolute melts!

For Hydrogen Fuel Cell, the cost (initial and running) will be off-putting, and the lack of infrastructure. The 'well to wheel' efficiency is awful (generating, transporting, storing each have losses). For ICE hydrogen that 'well to wheel' efficiency is even worse, and you have NOx emissions on top.\n\nFor commercial vehicles (long haul, trans-european etc), I think that's more likely where time criticality has a larger impact on the economics.

 '‚ÄúAlthough drivers tend to blame the FSD for their mistakes when a crash happens, this time, the driver was right, as data released by the federal government on Tuesday confirms.

The data also shows that the car abruptly slowed to 7 mph (11 kph), a dangerous move in fast-moving traffic.\n\nIt‚Äôs not certain what causes the phantom braking, which Tesla has yet to figure out and fix. Tesla has stripped its cars from every sensor except video cameras, which might be the main cause. After all, humans experience optical illusions, although rare. It could be that certain conditions, like a shadow moving fast across the camera, could trick the system into thinking there‚Äôs an object in front of the car and trigger a hard brake.‚Äù\n\nFSD may have been engaged but I believe FSD switches to AP on the interstate.'

 '>The FSD Beta software is pretty expert at finding the way in various traffic situations, and sometimes it behaves like an expert driver for hours in a row. This leads people to believe the system is good enough to rely on for everyday ‚Äúdriving.‚Äù Then, people get careless, attention slips, and, at the worst possible moment, they get a brutal reminder that FSD Beta is called ‚Äúbeta‚Äù for a reason.\n\nSo, a couple of notes that I think are important for public safety:\n\n1. The human driver is always driving when FSD Beta is active. FSD Beta requires an attentive human driver fallback ***at all times*** \\- the exact same as if the vehicle was not equipped with a partial automated driving system at all; and\n2. It is best to avoid anthropomorphizing engineered systems. Karpathy did this often and it is absurd - and dangerous. FSD Beta is not an ""expert"" at anything, nor is any automated driving system. What should be internalized is that engineered, safety-critical systems are validated within a target set of automated capabilities and within an Operational Design Domain (ODD) - ***the same as any other safety-critical system***. This distinction keeps the public from assigning human-like intelligence qualities and ethics to automated driving systems - which will only water down their own understanding of system limitations; and\n3. It is important to recognize that the term ""beta"" really has no meaning in safety-critical system parlance and it is especially meaningless for safety-critical systems provided to consumers that are outside of the system safety lifecycle for the program. Tesla is using the term as a cynical ""liability shift"" and it has ***zero*** meaning beyond that. Consumers should not be expected to appreciate that at ""the worse possible moment"".'

 ""So, this is pretty damning. But at the end of the day, the driver had ample time to accelerate and correct the issue. The driver is still part of this equation.\n\nTesla needs to make a better system here to maintain safety. Just turning off is not the answer. And if it is instructed to pull over when it's been forcibly disengaged due to an inattentive driver (but won't because it's in a tunnel), then it should be able to go to the next safest point and pull over.\n\nThis is a join issue between Tesla and the driver and both parties should be held liable.""

 ""Something stinks about all of this because FSD Beta is not active on freeways (yet, not until V11 which right now is only on employee cars).  There's a distinct visual difference in what's on the screen when FSD beta is active, and the news videos of them driving through same tunnel clearly shows it not active.   \n\nNow it could have been the EAP (enhanced auto pilot) but that's totally difference code from the beta FSD.""

 ""It's always struck me how people were willing to accept FSD even though it's such a new technology, I know in the future it'll be amazing but to get there things will have to be sacrificed to iron out the kinks like any new piece of technology.

 'I have fsd and have my concerns with it but basic road rules 101 say that if you hit someone in front of you it‚Äôs your fault, not theirs.

 ""I agree, it's not a perfect system. I also experienced phantom braking in the past, but ultimately, the driver is in control of the vehicle.\nHow can the driver allow the car to come to a complete stop on the freeway?\nWas the driver not paying attention?\nWhy didn't he step on the accelerator?\nDid he just sit there dumbfounded?\nIt is 100% his fault, just as if he would have stepped on the brake himself.\nUltimately who is getting the ticket, the driver or the car?""
 'I wish tesla added bright colored lights that indicated when a tesla had FSD or AP enabled to other drivers. \n\nAs it stands, i just give a wide berth to Teslas now.'

Anyone who uses any current driver assist system without being ready to take over is extremely negligent. \n\nI can‚Äôt think of a situation in which my car could slow from highway speeds to 7mph without being capable of taking over the gas pedal short of not being in the driver seat or completely passed out.']"

So it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre putting them out by initially asking for the ozone treatment.\n\nMy recommendation to you is to ask for a new car.  It‚Äôs something that you will always know about, and always remember.  1000 dead ants inside of body panels is pretty gross!'
 ""Ozone is pretty corrosive. I'd worry about it damaging the car, or at least putting premature wear on the interior.""
 'This might be better suited for the Tesla subreddit. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure what ‚Äúozoning‚Äù a vehicle would entail but in the property management world ozone is just getting rid of smell. So if that was the vocabulary used I would ask for a significant and detailed report as to what equipment and chemicals were used.'
 'Most Tesla models are sub-30 day lead times right now. Walk away, get another vehicle.'
 'True ozone machines (as opposed to just ionizing) will kill just about any microorganism including ants.'
 'If they know this is a problem why are there not using a different adhesive? I‚Äôve never heard of this before, not in any vehicle other than a Tesla.

 'Lol. Tesla vehicles have the weirdest issues.'

 'lemon\n\nsend it back...the car is compromised.'
 'What is this?  A CAR FOR ANTS?!?'
 'After seeing an ant issue on a car - something I have never heard of, you are still willing to buy that car? This would destroy any quality credibility I would have with the company. No one in the pre-sale inspection noticed all those ants? No confidence. Would not even buy a different new M3.'
 'If your new car is filled with ants, dead or alive, you absolutely should reject it. If they have overlooked an ant infestation in quality control before delivery, what else have they overlooked? You‚Äôll be stuck with a car with lower resale value once you sell it in a few years. I know you wanted to meet the March rebate deadline, but keep in mind that more and more car companies offer EVs, much higher in quality than Tesla.'
 'Not a new problem.\n\nEvidence here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ahsyel/wheel\\_ants\\_okay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ahsyel/wheel_ants_okay/)'
 'Ask for a refund'
 'I wouldn‚Äôt accept a car that needed this who knows what damage the car will take during the process even just removing and replacing parts could cause issues. If this is a known problem based on materials used by the company I‚Äôd seriously reconsider buying a Tesla at all. \n\nI‚Äôve never purchased a vehicle that had any known issues especially a new vehicle. I‚Äôd want to keep up that standard.'
 ""I'd get a new one or shop for something else. I would be looking around for ants constantly for months. I can imagine picking up carry out, get it home and feel this constant need to inspect every bite for ants.""
 'I‚Äôve used ozonators quite a bit and they‚Äôll scorch your lungs if you stay in the vicinity while the ozonator‚Äôs running. Ozone can be compared to the reaction of what happens when lightning strikes with the atmospheric air around us - similar to the smell/scent of a rainstorm with lightning. \n\nHowever, not only does it spell doom for your lungs if you‚Äôre in the vicinity while it‚Äôs being produced (while the treatment‚Äôs in process that is) it destroys fungus, mold, and other nasty things including insects. But it can damage electronics also - due to the oxygenation process. Electronics and ozone is not a good combo.'
 ""I'd refuse delivery and get a new one and hope that the new one doesn't use adhesive that attracts ants.  If you live in the Seattle area those tiny sugar ants are everywhere.  It wouldn't be a matter of if you got another infestation, it's when.""

 'Our Model 3 is a great car, but this is another example of a rookie mistake.\n\nOn one hand, it is great that Tesla is on the leading edge of technology and on the other hand, they make stupid mistakes because they lack the experience of the established brands.\n\nAn experienced engineer would have looked at the properties of that adhesive in intricate detail before deploying it in mass production.'

 'How many tons? How were they measured?'
 'why the fuck are you buying a tesla you moron?\n\ndo you idiots never learn anything? reject the delivery and get an electric vehicle from literally any car manufacturer that, you know, actually knows how to make cars without letting them get infested with ants and having the fucking steering wheel fall off randomly.'
 'I had ants in a car of mine last year. We moved to a new place and the ants left. Never found any bodies or anything left behind. It just kind of solved itself once the car moved away from wherever they were coming from.'
 'I think about how whenever I take something apart and put it back together, it always has one thing that just doesn‚Äôt fit or look right. So now imagine your car‚Ä¶. \nI‚Äôd have gotten a whole new one and demanded a discount or something other than Uber since they knew the ants could be an issue but never did a last QC check for any. Once they had the ants, will they vacuum them up..? What chems or treatments are they applying to the vehicle AND are they flushing AC systems and filters so you, your pets, your kids don‚Äôt get sick m??? Will this happen to you again when you bring the car home? \nAll things to think about'
 'embrace the ants' 'Ozone will work but they‚Äôll need to detail it'
 ""Yea, unless you need the car now i would have them sell it to someone else and get back in que. Ants going into cars isn't normal unless something attracted them there. You could be unlucky and while it was outside a queen managed to get inside and the others followed when it was raining. Its a stretch.""
 'I would not take delivery. Ask for a different one'
 'answer is mothballs, I have to use them to keep ants out of electrical boxes, motors, appliances - anything outside here in Floriduh.  IDK if they‚Äôre attracted to the electrical current or it‚Äôs just a coincidence, but they‚Äôre much more common in areas with an electrical circuit, AC or DC.  Maybe Teslas should come with a lifetime supply of mothballs.'
 'I have had ants in my car.  A friend spilled a large sweet tea in the floorboard and I didn‚Äôt clean it well enough.  Alas ants.  I vacuumed them up and cleaned the floorboard with a portable carpet cleaner.  No more ants, no more problems.  Though I don‚Äôt know why the ants are attracted to the adhesive, I imagine they won‚Äôt be once the adhesive is cured.  Also, it sounds like they are all on the outside of the car.  As in not past the door jams so, it seems like a car wash would get rid of the pests after they do the ozone treatment.  Also, since the manager said it has happened before it sounds like they know how to overcome the issue.  I would not want to wait another how long for another new car that might have the same issue.  Just me?'
 'Before I would accept that car, I would want detailed information on:\n\n* the species of ants,\n* the brand and type of adhesive,\n* all of the places in the car where that adhesive is used,\n* the concentration of ozone and the duration, and\n* any disassembly or cleaning that they will do.\n\nThen, I would:\n\n* do some internet research on how these ants behave. Can they survive in my climate? Will they come back if the eggs hatch (maybe not if the ozone kills the queen)?\n* consider how accessible the locations where the adhesive is, so that I could determine if the dead ants could easily be cleaned out.\n* consider how the ozone may cause damage to other parts of the car.\n\nKnowing Tesla, they would probably be unwilling to give me nearly enough details to make me comfortable accepting the car, but I would ask anyway before sending it back.'
 'Ants attracted to an adhesive?  I‚Äôve never heard of this, how is this possible?'
 'Learn to say no'
 'WTF, LOL. I mean did they charge you extra for the ants?'
 'So will you constantly have ants because this adhesive is in your car?'
 'üêú???\n\nThey seriously said it was an issue with Fremont cars ü§£'

Of course, you need to give the Teslas credit for having that suficcient range, but bear in mind that the cars in the next places aren't necessarily as far behind as you would assume from just looking at the total range in the test results, since many of them never got the chance to regenerate from climbing the mountain. So the results are real, but cannot be applied to anything other than that specific route driven in the test.""
 ""You can get great range in cold weather if you: \n\n- inflate the tires to 60psi \n- turn off all heat and heated seats\n- turn off the radio, configurable sub safety systems, and anything that isn't necessary to driving \n- throw everything out of the trunk and drink \n- possibly lightweight the car (OEM / stock class drag strip and circuit course guys know who cheat a little know what I mean)\n\nBasically do EVERYTHING that a normal use case drive would never do in an every day scenario.""

 'Install it. It works great'
 'I returned mine, took a little while but got 100% refund. As long as it‚Äôs new condition they should refund 100%'
 'While I have not accepted delivery yet I have installed a wall charger. I did this based off recommendations from friends who own Teslas. It is a convenience of not unplugging and storing the cable every day you ‚Äúmay‚Äù need a charge.'
 ""Just look at the return policy.  Hopefully you have not opened it so you can get a full refund and not get charged restocking fee.\n\n[https://www.tesla.com/support/shop](https://www.tesla.com/support/shop)\n\nI used to work in returns logistics for one of the big US wireless carriers and most people don't realize how costly returns are to vendors... that was an 8 digit cost for the carrier to maintain all of that return infrastructure (shipping cost and cost of return).""
 'Remember, a 14-50 (mobile connector would use this) has an extra conductor (2 hots, neutral, ground) compared to a Wall Connector which only needs 2 hots and a ground. 6/2 cable is much cheaper than 6/3. If you have a long length, the wall connector will save you money.\n\nFor me, I needed around 100ft of cable, which saved me around $200 running 6/2 instead of 6/3. Keep in mind that I did all the work myself. With an installer, you‚Äôll likely save more than just $200. Ontop of that, you can get 48amp charging (11kw).'
 'Returns are pretty easy, but slow. Returned my TPMS (because it was way cheaper on eBay) and it took a couple weeks to process even though they got it within days. 100% refund though.\n\nYou can drop it off at a service center too, but that just helps with it being received faster. The return still gets processed at their usual slow speed.'
 ""Honestly, the Wall Connector is fantastic. Haven't used the mobile charger because the wall connector is so much easy to use""
 'I installed mine before delivery and the idea of being able to go from 5% to 90% in 4-5 hours is huge a benefit'
 'If you using 220v, make sure you have the highest quality receptacle possible. The cheap home depot receptables are simply not designed to draw large currents for several hours year round.'
 'Def wall connector. It‚Äôs works so much better and convenient. I kept my mobile connector and just leave it in the frunk for emergencies.'
 'how much do you plan on driving it on a daily basis? The mobile charger is not a practical solution if you‚Äôll be driving more than 50-60 miles a day. It charges very slowly at about 4 mph. A full night charge will only give you like mayyyybee 50 miles if you keep it plugged in for 12 hrs straight'
 'Tesla customer service is awful. You could request a return and if they don‚Äôt honor it, challenge using your credit card and sell it on eBay. Then get the mobile connector.'
 'Tesla may accept your return, but just so your aware both those chargers charge at extremely different rates. Wall charger tops out at 5-6 hours for a full charge from 0%, while the mobile charger would take over a day or or 11 to 12 hours with a NEMA connection and appropriate amps. There are other variables, but a 60amp  wall connection will get 44 miles an hour charge Tesla States. So if you drive more in an average day than you can charge, you would net a loss in available range.'
 'I returned a wall connector during the waiting game and they took longer than I expected to issue a refund, to the extent that I did a chargeback through chase to get my money back.'
 'I ordered wall-charger too and waiting for MY delivery, with the fear of crossing 60 days return policy, I returned it. They said refund will be issued in a week and exactly in 7 days got the refund from the date of receipt.'
 'Both work fine but if you already have it just keep it and enjoy the faster speeds, yeah not too much difference if you have all night to charge but sometimes you just want to top up after work before you go out at night and the extra speed is very handy. To each their own but I always recommend the wall charger at home and a mobile always with you in the car just in case. It‚Äôs come in handy for me on those random nights you need just a little help while you‚Äôre out and about without a dedicated charger nearby'
 ""We have been using our mobile connector on a 110V outlet only to charge. Our mileage is around 1200 miles/month and mobile connector with free charging at work is enough for my daily rountrip commute of 54 miles.\nFor longer trips we plan just a bit and haven't needed supercharger top ups yet but that is also a backup option.\n\nYou could get a nema 14-50 installed and use the mobile connector instead of the dedicated wall connector. Charge speeds aren't that drastically different from a wall connector and you could potentially share your outlet for guest EVs.\n\nDepending on your need a Tesla wall connector or nema 14-50 outlet might be needed but we couldn't justify the cost of 1000$+ install since our panel is not in garage.""
 'The TWC is still one of the cheaper EVSE options unless you can get a cheaper one installed through incentives with your utility provider. What is the reason you were wanting to return it in favor for the UMC?'
 ""if you don't have the recepticle for the mobile connector might as well keep the wall connector install cost will be similar and you can charge faster.\n\nI bought the mobile connector anyways so I have one in case I need it.""
 'Mobile Charger tip‚Ä¶get the one in a clear plastic bag without the nylon case.  $185 only!  Ask the rep for it because it‚Äôs not on display.'

 'Return it. Install commercial-grade NEMA 14-50 on a 50amp GFCI breaker. Now, anyone can charge any electric car quickly. Someone (think future owner) could even switch out the breaker and use it for a welder or the like if they wanted.'
 'Yes I have a 2020 Model Y Performance I have the wall charger and the mobile charger,  I would advise just to use the mobile charger just get the 220V adapter and install the 220V outlet or if you have a 220V drier you can use that.  It‚Äôs chipper and it works the same as a wall charger.']"

Why isn\'t this talked about more??? \n\nI like my Model 3 for a lot of reasons and the value it offers as my work vehicle and racking up tons of miles, I can overlook some of the nitpicky things like diving through the controls for options that should be buttons or minimalistic interior and the quirks like the stalks, buttons, and phone/valet key are kind of nice once youre used to them. \n\nBut the suspension is by far my biggest quarrel with these cars. The road noise, while prevalent, doesn\'t bother me too much (I had a stupid custom silverado i traded in for the Tesla, with a lift and mud 35"" tires... if you wanna talk about rough ride and deafening road noiseü§£). But any kind of bumpy road or iterations in the road its like the suspension turns into plywood. Even though I find the seats pretty comfortable theres not much that can absorb that. It\'s to the point that my C8 was suposed to be my play toy car, but its so much better of a road trip GT car and better ride quality the Tesla gets left at home and my whole premise of owning it is the value proposition of owning it for racking up mileage and spending less. \n\nFor anyone I\'ve met, or ever talked to that was between justifying the price difference for something like a used S S or a 3, I would 100% recommend a used S just out of sheer ride confort with the adaptive suspension. Myself I\'m considering getting a \'20 Model S with the Raven suspension (or wait for the Plaids to keep dropping) out of the sheer fact I don\'t want to feel my spine rattling anymore. ü§£\n\nGreat write up though! All of the points you hit on are most definitely on par with a lot of sentiments with owning one long-term!'
 'How many miles were on it and what kind of tires? I rent from Avis and I‚Äôve noticed their cars have more and more miles on them, like instead of 10-20k I‚Äôm seeing 30-50k+.  As they get more miles they are forced to replace tires on one axle because they never rotate them so Avis buys the absolute cheapest shit they can.  I‚Äôve had some cars with 4 different brands of tire.'
 'Can confirm on the NVH. It‚Äôs even worse in the backseats. I‚Äôve ridden in my friend‚Äôs model 3 and several UBER drivers‚Äô model 3s, and every single one was so loud at highway speeds. It was louder than a Honda Civic and almost as loud as a Jeep Wrangler. Kinda crazy for an expensive car.'
 'For some amount of time, Tesla was struggling with sourcing components from their suppliers. Somewhat of a ""parts bin"" situation. Tesla\'s within the same model year might have different suspension components, etc.\n\nWe had two Teslas, same year same trim at work for testing. Couldn\'t really use both for testing because one was louder and one had tighter steering and suspension.\n\nF\'ing blast to race around a flooded autocross track though! That computer makes you feel like a hero and the power makes straightaways not so long.'
 ""Once you get past the initial wow of the minimalist interior and iPad aesthetic, you start to notice all this. The avg Tesla customer doesn't because they are not car people. But the rest of us notice the mediocre NVH, narrow and unsupportive rear seats, build quality issues, cheap feeling pleather, and overall lack of high end appointments.""
 'There‚Äôs a Woodmans in Kenosha with a couple dozen superchargers that would have added like 3 minutes of extra drive time to the trip. It‚Äôs too late for you, but if anyone is driving between Milwaukee and Chicago it literally could not be in a more convenient place to charge.'
 'Yup. Rented one in California for a week. \n\nnotable likes: amazing acceleration, google like maps and nav, and driver assistance (auto Pilot and cameras)\n\nMost notable dislikes: User interface, loud interior, and comfort. \n\nHertz: Had I not been with colleagues who had rented in the past, I would not have known about the minimum charge level that they would have happily dinged me with.'
 ""Suspension IS stupid harsh on OEM (or higher) tire pressures. \nLower those to 35ish psi and it'd be pretty normal sporty-ish ride. Still somewhat overdamped tho. \nThe noise is pretty surface-dependent. It would be very quiet or pretty noisy. Never had issues listening to podcasts doing 80-90mph tho.""
 'OP, I was literally thinking about doing the same thing this summer and thank you for this info. I am also going to Chicago for a convention and was going to visit my sister in law in Milwaukee. I was thinking about renting a Tesla because the price isn‚Äôt much worse than the economy. I‚Äôll just rent something more comfortable as you reminded me of the road situation in Chicago.'
 'When I rented a Model 3 from AVIS in Austin (October 2022) it was free to charge at any Tesla superchargers, and they let me know this when I rented. My hotel also had free charging, but it was a universal slow charger. There were also several other free charging options around the city at retailers, garages, etc‚Ä¶ I did not spend, nor was I charged for fuel. I did have to return at least 70% charged or they would charge a fee (so I was told).\n\nThe rest of your experience was pretty similar to mine.'
 'I live in Chicago. When I bought my Audi I had them ""downgrade"" the wheels to a smaller size to get more sidewall for the bumby ass roads. And I still feel relief when it\'s winter and I\'m on the softer snow tires. I can\'t imagine how bad a 3 with the suspension you describe would be.'
 'Also rented a TM3 through Hertz recently and did some long distancing driving. My experience matches your pretty much. But right now they‚Äôre going for a helluva deal that‚Äôs unbeatable. If I were in the market, it would be the first car on my shortlist.'
 'So, I daily a V60 and just recently borrowed a friend\'s Model 3 to go from Corpus Christi TX to DFW airport and back. Suspension really didn\'t bother me, and road noise was really only noticeable because there\'s zero engine noise to counteract it. Definitely wasn\'t a distraction or anything. The screen is fine after a day or two once you get things set. 90% of stuff in there you access once and it\'s saved to your profile. Superchargers are everywhere, and on the 900 mile round trip, I had to charge 7 times for 15-20 minutes each time. Most of those were combined with meals, so I maybe added an hour to the whole trip. Gas in my V60 would have cost about $150 for the trip, superchargers cost me $80. I\'m 5\'8"", 180lbs and while it wasn\'t Volvo comfortable, it was perfectly acceptable. Autopilot had the occasional hiccup, but I would say 95-99% of the time it was flawless. The most relaxing time I\'ve had doing that trip.\n\nAfter spending a week with it, we\'re ordering a Model Y.'
 'Every time my Uber/Lyft ride is a Model 3, I have to mentally and physically prepare myself for how bad of a ride it‚Äôs gonna be. That ride quality is no joke.'
 ""Got a Model 3 through Hertz a few weeks ago because it was the cheapest rental they had. After two days I couldn't wait to return it. Absolutely hated that car.""
 'Charging at home is really cheap tho'
 'Having driven 40k miles in a model 3 some of what you‚Äôve written is accurate, some is because you had it for 20 minutes and some of it is simply subjective. It‚Äôs not a perfect car but in many ways it feels like you just wanted to hate on a Tesla and spent the money to confirm your suspicions. \n\nAnd, no, I‚Äôm not a non-car guy. I love cars, driven most everything on the road and love many types of cars for different reasons.'
 ""Lol, the swirls and scratches are because it's a rental car, not because it's a Tesla.""
 'i test drove a model 3 lr and it honestly blew my mind.\n\nI agree with the statement about autopilot - it felt incomplete.  However, coming from a 370z the road noise was insanely minimal, suspension was comfortable, the seat felt as if i was sitting on a cloud, and the acceleration is really hard to wrap your head around. Also‚Ä¶ regen braking. Amazing.\n\nI‚Äôm now selling my Z and getting a Model 3 Performance.'
 ""I thought I'm the only one who finds the Model 3 very noisy at/above 70mph. With an ICE car you literally don't hear the engine at 70mph so it's generally quieter.""
 'Teslas have worse build quality than economy car Hyundais. Most people who buy the lower end models are trying to compensate for failing at life.'
 'Tesla makes terrible cars. Full stop. People buy them as status symbols or to greenwash. Nothing more.'
 ""Hertz brought (or channel stuffed?) a crap ton of Teslas and the fact they're renting them at near economy car level prices should be raising alarms not only to Tesla but also to Hertz, both of which are publicly traded companies. One of them is already taking massive losses however...\n\nI never rented from Hertz since I work at a major rival rental company, but I did have seat time behind a MY21 Model 3 SR+ during my days as an employee at a luxury brand dealership. Said car was very low mileage (<10,000km IIRC) unit which the former owner was fed up with the unreliability and trashy build quality and traded it in when used car prices let him walk away with equity.\n\nThe summary while not as much in the long distance driving department mirrors yours in its very bumpy ride and harsh NVH. These are VERY cheaply built and thrown together cars and it shows in every corner you look at, far beyond the panel gaps the size of your hand.\n\nThe biggest reason why these issues never are brought up is the same reason why TSLA trades higher than pretty much the next 10 major automotive manufacturers combined in market value - it is a full cult brand, even moreso than Apple. Before the past year, every single negative post regarding Tesla gets you targeted by fanatics, and while its narcissist of a CEO has finally shown his true colors and common consensus has turned on him, places like r/electricvehicles and heck this sub still has Tesla diehards who will go after you should you dare criticize their brand.\n\nNow in 2023 there are so many new and upcoming choices in EVs, you have to be real ignorant to pick a Tesla over anything else.""
 'I‚Äôm willing to bet you didn‚Äôt have a 2022 or newer Model 3? \n\nSuspension, NVH, steering wheel controls, build quality, and interior have all been updated. The difference between a 2018-2020 model 3 and answer one is relatively substantial considering most would just think it‚Äôs the same car.'
 ""Careful, OP... you'll draw the Ire of the Stans.\n\nProbably the worst thing in the world for tesla is their cars getting rented by normal car buyers.  They get a firsthand account of how horrible the cars are with zero commitment to buy one.  Imagine going on vacation somewhere you're not familiar & having to spend valuable time learning all the nuances of driving/managing a tesla that OP mentioned, and being rewarded with a crapcan that drives like a buckboard & is louder than a typical ICE sedan.""
 ""Why is it that whenever I see one of these things pop up, it seems like there's an entirely different problem? It's like Tesla tailors their problems to each individual customer/potential renter.""
 'This is a great, well thought out review. Looked at several Tesla models but wound up buying a GV80. Couldn‚Äôt bring myself to pay the EV premium when I could get so much more in an IC Genesis and it does considerably better on gas than the posted EPA mileage. Someday an EV but just not there yet.'
 'I checked out the Tesla Model 3 when I was just cross shopping for a luxury sedan. Definitely impressive acceleration, but it in no way justifies the cost. I ended up an Integra that blows it out of the water in all categories but acceleration, and it‚Äôs a much cheaper car. Tesla Model 3 RWD should be 30k before tax credits and then it might be a more interesting value. \n\nAlso, the model 3 RWD sound system is the worst I‚Äôve heard. The other models get an upgrade.'
 ""Superb post. Thanks for sharing this. OP try posting this in Tesla motors. The fan boys and the mods will ban you for saying anything negative about Musk or about the car! Soup nazis of the Musk variety they are üôÑ\n\nI'd be interested in long term reviews of people too like 1,3, 5,7 years etc. How the interior holds up. Paint, squeaks etc and other issues if any. If they are the Toyota of the ev world as far as reliability is concerned despite the rattles and anesthetics not upto par.\n\nIs the model Y better in build and noise insulation?""
 'I have a 2022 3LR, prior to I had a diesel pickup.  The first month or two was just horrible in the Tesla due to lack of knobs/controls.  A year later, I prefer it to a cluttered dashboard.  It definitely has great acceleration and I think it rides well, but considering my last had 35s and a lift, not sure that‚Äôs a good comparison.  But hands down, what I love best is $80/electric charge vs $600/mo fuel.  Also Tesla supercharger network is phenomenal, the other networks can be hit or miss, but a Tesla charger is rarely broken.  When you supercharge a Tesla you pull in, open charge door, plug in and that‚Äôs it.  Other networks you have to jack with some app download, setting up another account, sometimes doesn‚Äôt connect or the charger itself won‚Äôt stay going, they are just a real mess.  As long as fuel stays high and electricity stays reasonable, EVs make sense for commuting.'

 ""Looking up the curb weight of Tesla model 3 and S are much heavier because of the battery,  and the fact that they both of the cab forward design would contribute to cabin noise. Plus if the build has less sound dampening materials, and build quality of each unit built. Since tesla is a new comer to mass product what takes time to refine. Look at the cars we drove from the 1980s and 90s compared to today from the mass producers today you will a big difference.  My wife had a 2001 Intrepid which is a cab forward design of the modern era , it had road noise more than other cars of its class. But the best test for any individual is to drive it long distance to see if you like it doesn't matter make model or brand I know because I used to work in car rental industry and have driven lots of long distance driving in many types and models.""

 'Suspension could simply be contributed to the low profile tires.

 'I‚Äôm currently driving one as well, courtesy from Hertz. I think I‚Äôm paying 65 a day? Not bad for me considering a Chevy Spark or Nissan Versa shitbucket is 55 a day. I wanted a Genesis sedan but those were renting for something insane like 115 a day‚Ä¶ fuck that.\n\nI was also given a fairly beat up Model 3. It‚Äôs a 2022 with 4800 miles and holy hell are the passenger side curbed. No dents or anything but the windows are scratched, swirls for days, no floor mats, and it was given to me dirty as fuck, and only 50 miles of range remaining. It‚Äôs ironic because Hertz demands you return it with 70% charge. Whatever, fuck you Hertz.\n\nI‚Äôm still driving it while my M235i is getting it‚Äôs front end replaced after a hit and ruin, no I didn‚Äôt hit anyone someone hit my car while it was parked. Anyways I‚Äôm really enjoying it, very smooth and effortless car to drive, and even in the highway my specific Model 3 isn‚Äôt too bad. The suspension is garbage I agree, feels like it‚Äôs broken or something. Steering on the other hand is direct and I like the weight of it. \n\nI don‚Äôt mind the screen, yeah it takes a bit to get used to but it‚Äôs much more intuitive to use than some of the other infotainments offerings out there right now. Once you set everything up in the controls tab it sticks, so I don‚Äôt mind it. It‚Äôs also almost instant to boot up unlike some Hondas or MINIs I‚Äôve driven\n\nI live in Boston so it‚Äôs quite cold right now, and I‚Äôm noticing my battery isn‚Äôt lasting too long between driving and heating up the battery. I‚Äôm having to charge every other day or every two days, and every days is pushing it close. Charging itself isn‚Äôt bad as I just hit a supercharger on my way home from work, and the car lets me watch Netflix/YouTube while it charges, so I can‚Äôt complain.\n\nAll in all I really like it, it‚Äôs a different experience compared to the cars I‚Äôve owned (M235i, S2000, Cooper S), and it fits my life quite good. Would I get one? Not right now, but it‚Äôs on my radar now for next possible cars.'
 ""The ride quality and NVH on older Model 3/Y is dogshit. ALLEGEDLY they have improved this very recently with new dampers, and better noise insulating glass etc but on my friend's 2020 3 and my mom's 2021 Y, holy fuck it's bad. i did a quick measurement using my apple watch and it was over 6 db louder than my 2017 A4 (twice as loud since 6db means double) \n\nI was a rear seat passenger on a trip to NYC from Boston in my mom's Y and it's genuinely one of the worst rear seat experiences i've had and that's compared to multi hour rides in Kias, cars that cost half as much. \n\nI haven't driven a newer production vehicle but if they cut the NVH and improved the suspension I'd be pleased.""

 'Currently 2 days into a 4 day rental with a 2023 Model 3 which had less than 100 miles when I got it. First time driving an EV. The constant and instant torque is addicting and made me way more confident in merging in traffic.\n\nNVH is worse than my Outback, but similar to other ""economy"" sedans I\'ve rented recently. Interior materials / build is also similar to the premium ""leather"" trims on economy cars -- ex an EX-L Civic or whatnot. Maybe a step above with more soft-touch things.\n\nI\'ve learned to be OK with the infotainment. The cameras and such are fantastic for backing up and I like how well it senses the cars around me while driving. Also the built in maps are nearly as good as Google Maps IMHO. Biggest gripe is HVAC controls requiring a few presses.\n\nHonestly, my 2 biggest gripes are how over-reactive the auto-braking is -- I\'ve had the car aggressively brake when there\'s a oncoming car ahead turning across my lane a good 50 yards out and has plenty of time to clear and the Tesla thinks I\'m going to hit it or something. My Outback\'s EyeSight would never brake that far out for such a quick blip\n\nThe other thing is the lack of faster chargers. I looked on the EV charging app PlugShare and saw there were a few in the area I\'m staying. What I didn\'t realize is that they were only 6-7.2kWh chargers... Walking away for 30 minutes to go get some lunch and I assumed I would have gained 20-30% at least and was quite shocked to come back to only 5-6% gained. I had to go drive 8 miles away to the closest super charger to get back to 100% when I got down to 35% early today.']"

 'My 2.5 ton SUV on skinny street tires will handle this loose shifty sand NO PROBLEM.'

 'Ladies and gentleman: The EV Crowd'

 'As a relative noob to tires, is this worse?'
 'I took delivery of my Model S in December. I have 19 inch rims and Continental ProContact on all four.'
 'Mine came with continental on the front and Michelin on the back'
 'Tesla has used Goodyear before.'
 'PS4 are back ordered for months the Last time I checked. \n\nFor the 21s they use 295s in the the back. I took delivery of my s plaid in June and within 3 days I had a nail in my tire well, not patchable, America‚Äôs tire, Costco etc all said they wouldn‚Äôt any access to 295s for at least 4-6 months. \n\nEven Tesla didn‚Äôt have any at service centers until one of the parts guy‚Äôs rolled up his sleeves and found a brand new one sitting in the back storage. Younger kid. üôåüèΩ service advisor was telling me minimum 3 weeks. Tesla has first access to 295 tires. According to dude at America‚Äôs tire. So everyone else gets the them after. \n\nOn a side note - I‚Äôm salty the new ones come with red calipers and a larger screen in back‚Ä¶I wanted red!'
 ""Visited my local Tesla SC and this 2023 Model S was being delivered. Possible supply chain issue. I've known them all to come with Michelins.""
 'tesla wants to compete with toyota instead of lexus'
 ""my MYP came with michelin all sports and you're telling me model S comes with goodyear? what ?""
 'And no USS'
 'Love the reductive logic by people here where quality of a product is reduced to its mere brand.  Omg NOT-michelins!!!!\n\nYou ‚Äúnon-tire-folk‚Äù understand the current generation of Eagle F1 Assymetric is on par with Pilot Sport 4 in the high performance category, and Eagle F1 Supersport is the same with Pilot Sport 4S for extreme performance category?\n\nNevermind current Tesla Model 3 comes with anything from Continental to Hankook to Nokian to Pirelli, depending on the region and climate requirements. Because manufacturers make a variety models in all product categories so no 1 is blanket better than the other'
 'Slow news day.'
 'Michelin shortage. There have been instances where tires were substituted.'
 'Oh my God! Not Michelins!! Wow.'
 'I was on Michelin PS4 and it lasted only 40,000 km (25,000 miles) just swapped to Goodyear Eagle F1 Sports. So far so good, have not rained for a while but dry grip and handling is sportier than PS4\n\nNot on a Tesla but a 10th gen civic'
 'I prefer the Michelins' 'So what?' 'Cutting corners whenever they can.'
 'Spendy tire in this size' 'I have Michellin! I got lucky I guess lol'
 'Ohhhh guyss look new tires never seen them on any car must be special'
 'Wow'
 'This corner cutting has me looking much harder at the competition. The Kia EV6 is far and away better and at a similar price point.'
 'Seems like costcutting. Goodyear isn‚Äôt a tire I‚Äôd ever buy' 'LOL'
 'I‚Äôve always got the impression Goodyear ties are only for nascar racing.. too much American tv for me'
 ""I wonder at what point will Tesla decide to make their own tires? Doesn't make sense at this volume, but what about when they go to 15M+ vehicles per year? I think at that point it would make sense to make their own tires. \n\nMichelin for example sells 200M tires a year. That's 40M cars worth of tires. At 20M cars per year - if you account for the cars on the road, Tesla would need around 200M tires per year. Just napkin mathing this thing.""
 'That‚Äôs good. I can‚Äôt stand Michelins. All hype. Got these recently for my Model S. Completely amazing tire. Designed for our cars. Made it a new car.

 'Between the calipers and the tires now, the cost cutting is getting bolder and bolder.'
 ""Probably shouldn't have parked there while the were doing the line marking. /s""
 'I would never put Goodyears on my Tesla..' 'Weeeeeeeeeee'
 'My 2023 S came with Continental.'
 'Does my plaid have different for a reason? Michelin Pilot Sport'
 'My grandfather would only buy a new car if it had Michelins on it. It would literally be a dealbreaker for him.'
 'My 2021 MS LR (last of the Legacy MS‚Äô before the refresh) came with 19‚Äù Goodyear Eagle‚Äôs. 11,000 miles and no issues. Super quiet and grippy.'
 'What about Firestone, I had em twice and no problem yet they are cheaper.'
 ""A family member works for Michelin and on larger projects says Musk is unpleasable and wants it all with no compromise. That's one thing they don't tell you about those cars is that they eat tires due to weight and torque.""
 'I wish Tesla used all season 3PMSF tires, and that tires had quantitative test data.'
 ""I've been hearing about a Michelin tire shortage for quite a while. wonder if this is supply, not cost cutting. the eagle sports are good for UHP all season (not really bad to put all seasons on a long range) but they're not P4S/AS4's""
 'amazing' 'So is 2023 going to be a good‚Ä¶.'
 'Odd my Plaid on tempest wheels had Pirelli. Swapped them by tesla service and they also just gave me Pirelli'
 ""I've had Michelin tires that were crap....""
 'I assume another Tesla cost savings. Getting the feeling Tesla is hurting more and more.'
 'These are good tires too']"
