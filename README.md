Author: Yuxi Qiao, Xu Zhang

In this project, we aim to analysis people's opinions on Tesla models by studying the comments about it on YouTube and Reddit, to gain an insight into what people really think about it.

The project is carried out in 3 steps:
Step1, extract comments feom Reddit posts and YouTube vidos with key word 'Tesla Model'.  
Step2, use 2 different tools ([VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) and [RoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692)) to analyze the sentiments in the comments extracted in step1.
